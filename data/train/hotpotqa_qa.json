    "question": "Based on the context: Net register tonnage: Net register tonnage (NRT, nrt, n.r.t.) is a ship's cargo volume capacity expressed in \"register tons\", one of which equals to a volume of 100 cuft .  It is calculated by subtracting non-revenue-earning spaces i.e. spaces not available for carrying cargo, for example engine rooms, fuel tanks and crew quarters, from the ship's gross register tonnage.  Net register tonnage is not a measure of the weight of the ship or its cargo, and should not be confused with terms such as deadweight tonnage or displacement. Olympic-class ocean liner: The \"Olympic\"-class ocean liners were a trio of British ocean liners built by the Harland & Wolff shipyard for the White Star Line during the early 20th century.  They were \"Olympic\" (1911), \"Titanic\" (1912), and \"Britannic\" (1915).  All three were designed to be the largest and most luxurious passenger ships in the world, designed to give White Star an advantage in the transatlantic passenger trade.  Two were lost early in their careers: \"Titanic\" sank in 1912 on its maiden voyage, after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean, and \"Britannic\" in 1916, after hitting a mine laid by the minelayer submarine \"U-73\" in a barrier off Kea in the Aegean Sea during World War I.  \"Olympic\", the lead vessel, had a career spanning 24 years and was retired in 1934 and sold for scrapping in 1935. Nimrod (ship): Nimrod was the ship Ernest Shackleton used in his 1908 Antarctic Nimrod Expedition for the South Pole.  It was a 41-year-old schooner of 334 gross register tons that had been used to hunt seals and whales.  Shackleton, who paid £5,000 for the ship, had it re-rigged as a barquentine.  It also had an auxiliary steam engine, but had a top speed of only six knots under this power.  In addition, the ship was so overloaded with supplies for the expedition that it could not carry enough coal to make passage to the Antarctic from New Zealand, and Shackleton had to arrange for the ship to be towed to the edge of the pack ice by tramp steamer \"Koonya\".  The New Zealand government paid half the cost of the tow; Sir James Mills, Chairman of the Union Steamship Company, paid the other half.  The \"Koonya\" was captained by Fredrick Pryce Evans during the tow. Question: The largest ship in the \"Imperator\" class ocean liners had how many gross register tons?",

Originally, the Beltrán Leyva cartel operated in the city, but the group no longer has presence in Acapulco.  After the Mexican military gunned down the top boss of the cartel – Arturo Beltrán Leyva – in December 2009, his brother Héctor Beltrán Leyva took control of one of the factions of the cartel and declared war on Edgar Valdez Villarreal, who had long been the right hand of Arturo.  Amidst the violence, Valdez Villarreal tried to appoint a successor, but those in Acapulco broke off and formed their own criminal gang: the Independent Cartel of Acapulco.  Within weeks, however, the group had splittered too, forming a new and rival group known as La Barredora.  Villarreal Valdez was then captured by the Mexican Federal Police in August 2010, but the violence between the groups for the control of Acapulco continued.

    "question": "Based on the context: Let There Be Love (1953 Joni James album): Let There Be Love is Joni James debut album, recorded in 1953 and released by MGM Records at the end of the year.  It was released in a four-disc 10-inch 78-rpm record box, in both a two-disc 7-inch 45-rpm extended-play foldout album and a four-disc 45-rpm regular-play box and on a 10-inch 33⅓-rpm album.  The serial number, 222, coincidentally included James's lucky number, \"22,\" which appeared in many of her record serial numbers all over the world.  The album is the first to present its songs as a book in music, opening with \"Let There Be Love\" and closing with \"I'll Be Seeing You\", with the songs telling a story start to finish.  The memorable cover was done at M-G-M Pictures Studios in Culver City by artist Russ Gale.  From the album a single of \"Let There Be Love\" and \"You're Nearer\" was shipped to radio stations.  Then, by public demand, a single of \"You're My Everything\" and \"You're Nearer\" was released.  This album offered Joni's second recording of \"Let There Be Love,\" which had been released in an earlier version in 1952 as her first single on Sharp Records in Chicago, then going to M-G-M Records for further distribution.  Both recordings were arranged and conducted by Lew Douglas.  \"Let There Be Love\" went to the top of the album charts and was the sixth-best-selling album of 1953.  In 1956 the album was reissued as a 12-inch L.P. and in three single EPs; there was no EP set including the entire album.  For this release, four Joni James singles were added, but one of them had never been released.  That was \"I Need You Now,\" which was to have followed the hit \"My Love, My Love\" but was canceled when Eddie Fisher came out with a version recorded several weeks after Joni's.  M-G-M had expected Joni's original version to go straight to #1.  For the new album the first four songs and second four songs were switched to get \"You're My Everything\" in the outside groove of the L.P. to facilitate disc jockey play.  So, for 50 years, the story the album tells has been garbled.  In 1961 the album got new cover art, a new serial number (E3931), and an electronically simulated stereo release.  Released again on compact disk with yet more bonus tracks, the album is in its fifth decade as a best seller.  Joni James hopes for yet another release which will restore the original song order.  Significantly, for her last M-G-M album, \"Bossa Nova Style\", Joni included new recordings of several songs from \"Let There Be Love\", including a new single of \"You're Nearer.\"  That album was arranged by Lew Douglas's protégé Chuck Sagle.  This information comes from Wayne Brasler, longtime President of the Joni James International Fan Club and the writer of the album notes for all Joni James' CD releases. Say It Right: \"Say It Right\" is a song by Canadian singer Nelly Furtado from her third studio album \"Loose\" (2006).  Written by Furtado, Tim \"Timbaland\" Mosley and Nate \"Danja\" Hills, the song was inspired by, as Furtado described it, the \"spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound\" of the band Eurythmics, specifically their 1983 song \"Here Comes the Rain Again\".  The song released as the album's third single in North America and Australia (see 2006 in music).  The song served as the album's fourth single in certain European and Asian countries.  It was released digitally in the United Kingdom in March 2007.  It was the album's fifth single in Latin America. Ascension (Gorillaz song): \"Ascension\" is a song by alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz, featuring Vince Staples.  The song was released on 23 March 2017.

    "question": "Based on the context: Greenwich Mean Time: Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London.  GMT was formerly used as the international civil time standard, now superseded in that function by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  Today GMT is considered equivalent to UTC for UK civil purposes (but this is not formalised) and for navigation is considered equivalent to UT1 (the modern form of mean solar time at 0° longitude); these two meanings can differ by up to 0.9 s. Consequently, the term GMT should not be used for precise purposes. Fractional lambda switching: Fractional lambda switching (FλS) leverages on time-driven switching (TDS) to realize sub-lambda switching in highly scalable dynamic optical networking, which requires minimum (possibly optical) buffers.  Fractional lambda switching implies switching fractions of optical channels as opposed to whole lambda switching where whole optical channels are the switching unit.  In this context, TDS has the same general objectives as optical burst switching and optical packet switching: realizing all-optical networks with high wavelength utilization.  TDS operation is based on time frames (TFs) that can be viewed as virtual containers for multiple IP packets that are switched at every TDS switch based on and coordinated by the UTC (coordinated universal time) signal implementing pipeline forwarding.  In the context of optical networks, synchronous virtual pipes SVPs typical of pipeline forwarding are called fractional lambda pipes (FλPs). Civil time: In modern usage, civil time refers to statutory time scales designated by civilian authorities, or to local time indicated by clocks.  Modern civil time is generally standard time in a time zone at a fixed offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), possibly adjusted by daylight saving time during part of the year.  UTC is calculated by reference to atomic clocks, and was adopted in 1972.  Older systems use telescope observations.

It emerged as a style of post-hardcore from the mid-1980s hardcore punk movement of Washington, D.C., where it was known as emotional hardcore or emocore and pioneered by Washington, D.C. hardcore bands such as Rites of Spring and Embrace.  However, as the genre was taken up by a new generation of musicians in the early 1990s, its sound and meaning shifted and changed and it was reinvented as a style of indie rock and pop punk by bands such as Jawbreaker, Sunny Day Real Estate, Weezer, and Jimmy Eat World.  By the mid-1990s, numerous emo acts such as Braid, The Promise Ring, and the Get Up Kids emerged in the Midwestern and Central United States, and several independent record labels began to specialize in the genre.  Meanwhile, a more aggressive style of emo, screamo, had also emerged, pioneered by the San Diego bands Heroin and Antioch Arrow.

He became famous and wealthy from flying exhibitions, staging aerial stunts, helping invent aerobatics, and setting aviation records. List of British airships: Airship development in the United Kingdom lagged behind that of Germany and France.  The first British designed and built airship was constructed by Stanley Spencer, and on 22 September 1902 was flown 30 mi from Crystal Palace, London to Ruislip, carrying an advertisement for baby food.  A series of more practical airships was constructed by Ernest Willows, the \"Willows Number 1\" making its first flight near Cardiff on 5 August 1905.  The Royal Navy realised that airships similar to Ferdinand von Zeppelin's designs could be of great use and in 1909 ordered construction of a rigid airship.  This was completed in 1911 but was wrecked while leaving the hangar before it had flown.  Meanwhile, the British Army's School of Ballooning, later the Air Battalion Royal Engineers, acquired a small fleet of semi-rigid and non-rigid airships for observation purposes; they were taken over by the Royal Navy on the creation of the Royal Naval Air Service in 1914.  A large number of rigid and non-rigid airships were mainly used to counter the U-Boat campaign in World War I.  Interest in military airships declined at the end of the war, but some success in the commercial field inspired the Imperial Airship Scheme; however, the disastrous crash of the R101 in 1930 ended serious government and commercial interest in airships.  Since the 1970s, there have been persistent efforts to revive a British airship industry, using new designs, materials and technologies.

The type species is \"S. syrticus\" of late Miocene Africa, which reached roughly 4 m (13.1 ft) in shoulder height.  The other unequivocally recognized species is \"S. orbus\", also of late Miocene Africa.  Other species outside of Africa are questionably placed in this genus, including teeth from Late Miocene Hungary and Iran originally described as being of the \"Mastodon\" subgenus \"Bunolophodon\", Chinese specimens originally described as being also of \"Mastodon\", as well as of \"Tetralophodon\" and \"Stegodon\", and a species from the late Miocene-aged Dokh Pathan Formation in Pakistan, \"S. maluvalensis\". Volvopluteus michiganensis: Volvopluteus michiganensis is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae.

The cap of this mushroom is about 7 – in diameter, gray, and has a cracked margin that is sticky when fresh.  The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink.  The stipe is white and has a volva at the base.  Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating this taxon from related species.  \"V. michiganensis\" is a saprotrophic fungus that was originally described as growing on sawdust.  It has only been reported from Michigan (USA) and the Dominican Republic. Jurodidae: The beetle family Jurodidae was originally described from fossils, but in 1996, a single species from the Russian Far East, described as Sikhotealinia zhiltzovae, was found and later was recognized to be a living representative of this otherwise extinct family (a \"living fossil\").  Since then, this beetle, known from only a single specimen, has been the source of contention, as it is reported to possess three ocelli on its forehead, a condition otherwise unknown in the entire order Coleoptera, whether extinct or living - though it is common in other orders, and generally considered a groundplan character for neopteran insects.  If true, this species may represent the most archaic of all living beetles.  However, other authorities have challenged this interpretation, and have further suggested that this beetle does not even belong to the Archostemata.  This may not be possible to resolve until additional specimens are collected, allowing for genetic analysis.

    "question": "Based on the context: Norm O'Neill: Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 – 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia.  A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958.  Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959–60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India.  His career peaked in 1960–61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25.  His performances on the 1961 tour of England saw him named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year.  Thereafter his form was less formidable, characterised by nervousness and fidgeting at the start of his innings.  Persistent knee problems as well as a controversial media attack on the legality of West Indian bowler Charlie Griffith saw him dropped from the Australian team after 1965.  O'Neill also bowled occasional leg spin and was regarded as one of the finest fielders of his era.  He later became a cricket commentator and his son Mark O'Neill also played cricket at state level. Sunil Gavaskar: Sunil Manohar \"Sunny\" Gavaskar    (born 10 July 1949) is an Indian former cricketer who played during the 1970s and 1980s for the Bombay cricket team and Indian national team.  Widely regarded as one of the greatest opening batsmen in cricket history, Gavaskar set world records during his career for the most Test runs and most Test centuries scored by any batsman.  He held the record of 34 Test centuries for almost two decades before it was broken by Sachin Tendulkar in December 2005.  He was the first person to score centuries in both innings of a Test match three times.  He was the first Test batsman to score 10,000 Test Runs in a Career and now stands at number 12 on the group of 13 players with 10,000+ Test Runs. Z-test: A \"Z\"-test is any statistical test for which the distribution of the test statistic under the null hypothesis can be approximated by a normal distribution.  Because of the central limit theorem, many test statistics are approximately normally distributed for large samples.  For each significance level, the \"Z\"-test has a single critical value (for example, 1.96 for 5% two tailed) which makes it more convenient than the Student's \"t\"-test which has separate critical values for each sample size.  Therefore, many statistical tests can be conveniently performed as approximate \"Z\"-tests if the sample size is large or the population variance is known.  If the population variance is unknown (and therefore has to be estimated from the sample itself) and the sample size is not large (n < 30), the Student's \"t\"-test may be more appropriate.

Socialism of the 21st century argues that both free-market industrial capitalism and twentieth-century socialism have failed to solve urgent problems of humanity, like poverty, hunger, exploitation, economic oppression, sexism, racism, the destruction of natural resources, and the absence of a truly participative democracy.  Therefore, because of the local unique historical conditions, socialism of the 21st century is often contrasted with previous applications of socialism in other countries and aims for a more decentralized and participatory planning process.  Socialism of the 21st century has democratic socialist elements, but primarily resembles Marxist revisionism. 21st century in fiction: Many science fiction works have been set in the 21st century (years 2001 to 2100).

    "question": "Based on the context: Elizabeth Brontë: Elizabeth Brontë ( , \"commonly\" ; 181525 June 1825) was the second daughter and child of Reverend Patrick Brontë and his wife, Maria.  She was born in Hartshead, Yorkshire. Meroplankton: Meroplankton is a term used to describe a wide variety of planktonic organisms, which spend a portion of their lives in the benthic region of the ocean.  These organisms do not remain as plankton permanently, rather, they are planktonic components in transition, which eventually become larger organisms.  After a period of time in the plankton, meroplankton either graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor.  Meroplankton consists of larval stages of organisms such as sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans and dinoflagellates and diatoms.  Meroplankton forms an algal medium that is found between the loosely mixed sediments and water.  This layer can be re-suspended in the water column by turbulent mixing.  Success of meroplankton populations depends on many factors, such as adult fecundity, fertilization success, growth and larval stage duration, behaviour, dispersal, and settlement.  Mortality depends on many factors, such as predation, competition, disease, parasites, and physiological stresses.  Survival and mortality of meroplankton has a direct effect on adult population numbers of many species.  Many of the common, well-known animals found on the Great Barrier Reef spend time as free-swimming meroplankton, bearing little or no resemblance to the adult they will become.  The differences between the appearance of larval and adult stages led to much confusion in the past when larval forms were often believed to be completely different species from the adults.  Larvae spend varying amounts of time in the plankton, from minutes to over a year.  However, just how long these tiny animals can be considered truly planktonic is under some debate. Michael Montague (priest): Rev. Michael Montague (17731845) was an Irish Roman Catholic priest and educator, from the parish of Errigal-Kiernan in County Tyrone.  He was educated for the priesthood first at Clare Castle Seminary, Tandragee, County Armagh, and then at St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, County Kildare, where he was to spend his adult life.  He was a student at Maynooth from the college's opening in November 1795.  He was ordained deacon for the Armagh Archdiocese by Archbishop O'Reilly, ordained priest by the president of the college at Maynooth, Dr. Peter Flood, and encouraged to take up a position in the college.  He served as bursar and vice-president from 1816, and was elevated to president in 1834.  He resigned the office of president in 1845 due to ill health, and died in October that year.

    "question": "Based on the context: Cardwellia: Cardwellia is a genus of a sole described species of large trees, constituting a part of the plant family Proteaceae.  The species Cardwellia sublimis (northern silky oak) grows naturally only (endemic) in the rainforests of the wet tropics region of north eastern Queensland, Australia.  Other common names include bull oak, golden spanglewood, lacewood, oak and oongaary.  The compound leaves have up to 17 leaflets.  It produces white inflorescences followed by woody fruits which are prominently displayed outside the canopy. Twist-necked turtle: The twist-necked turtle, \"Platemys platycephala\", also known as the flat-headed turtle, is distributed widely across northern South America.  Twist-necked turtles have extremely flat shells that help them hide from predators under rocks and debris.  When threatened, this turtle withdraws by twisting its head into its shell.  \"P. platycephala\" is the only species of the genus \"Platemys\" and occurs in northern and central South America.  \"Platemys platycephala\" means “flat turtle, flat-head” and accurately describes the structure of the head and shell.  This species inhabits shallow creek beds and frequently forages on the floor of the Amazon rainforest for insects, amphibians, and mollusks.  Camouflage, head and body shape, and advanced sexual anatomy allow this species of turtle to effectively populate much of South America.  Mating occurs during rainy months (March–December) and egg deposit occurs during dry months (January–March).  Males have been known to behave aggressively towards females during copulation by squirting water from nostrils and biting.  A few genomic studies show mosaicism exists among populations of the twist-necked turtle in Surinam.  In other words, diploid and triploid levels exist among individuals at this particular location.  No threats have been reported for this species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature does not have a current listing.  Lack of human consumption due to the species' small size and its wide range explain why scientists are not concerned about this turtle species. Alternanthera philoxeroides: Alternanthera philoxeroides, commonly referred to as alligator weed, is a native species to the temperate regions of South America, which includes Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

Its geographic range once used to cover only the Parana River region of South America, but it has since expanded to cover over 30 countries, such as the United States, New Zealand, China and many more.  This invasive species is believed to have been accidentally introduced to these non-native regions through sediments trapped/attached to tanks and cargo of ships travelling from South America to these various areas.

    "question": "Based on the context: Bicarbonate indicator: A bicarbonate indicator (hydrogencarbonate indicator) is a type of pH indicator that is sensitive enough to show a color change as the concentration of carbon dioxide gas in an aqueous solution increases.  The indicator is used in photosynthesis and respiration experiments to find out whether carbon dioxide is being liberated.  It is also used to test the carbon dioxide content during gaseous exchange of organisms.  When the carbon dioxide content is higher than 0.04%, the initial red color changes to yellow as the pH becomes more acidic.  If the carbon dioxide content is lower than 0.04%, it changes from red to magenta and, in relatively very low carbon dioxide concentrations, to purple.  Carbon dioxide, even in the concentrations found in exhaled air, will dissolve in the indicator to form carbonic acid, a weak acid, which will lower the pH and give the characteristic colour change.  A colour change to purple during photosynthesis shows a reduction in the percentage of carbon dioxide and is sometimes inferred as production of oxygen, but there is not actually any direct evidence for it. Atelocyanobacterium thalassa: \"Candidatus\" Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (previously cyanobacterium UCYN-A,) is a species of cyanobacteria commonly found throughout the world's oceans.  Unlike many other cyanobacteria, \"A. thalassa\" lacks the ability to perform photosynthesis.  Instead, it is found in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae.  \"A. thalassa\" fixes nitrogen for the algae, while the algae provides carbon for \"A. thalassa\" through photosynthesis. Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria: Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria (AAPBs) are alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteriathat are obligate aerobes that capture energy from light by anoxygenic photosynthesis.  Anoxygenic photosynthesis is the phototrophic process where light energy is captured and stored as ATP.  The production of oxygen is non-existent and, therefore, water is not used as an electron donor.  They are widely distributed marine plankton that may constitute over 10% of the open ocean microbial community.  They can be particularly abundant in oligotrophic conditions where they were found to be 24% of the community.  Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria are photoheterotrophic (phototroph)microbes that exist in a variety of aquatic environments.  Photoheterotrophs(Gk: photo = light, hetero = (an)other, troph = nourishment), are heterotrophic organisms that use light to produce energy, but are unable to utilize carbon dioxide as their primary carbon source.  Most are obligately aerobic, meaning they require oxygen to grow.  One remarkable aspect of these novel bacteria is that they, unlike other similar bacteria, are unable to utilize BChl (bacteriochlorophyll) for anaerobic growth.The only photosynthetic pigment that exists in AAPB is BChl a.

He is noted as a member of Blue Mink, T. Rex and Sky and as one of Britain's best-known session bass players, having contributed to recordings by Elton John (\"Tumbleweed Connection\", \"Madman Across the Water\"), David Bowie (\"Space Oddity\", \"Diamond Dogs\"), Lou Reed (\"Transformer\", including the prominent bass line of \"Walk on the Wild Side\"), Melanie (\"Candles in the Rain\"), Roy Harper (\"Bullinamingvase\"), David Essex (\"Rock On\"), Allan Clarke, Al Kooper (\"New York City (You're a Woman)\"), Bryan Ferry (\"The Bride Stripped Bare\"), Harry Nilsson (\"Nilsson Schmilsson\", \"Son of Dracula\"), Cat Stevens (\"New Masters\", \"Foreigner\"), Serge Gainsbourg (\"Histoire de Melody Nelson\"), Paul McCartney (\"Give My Regards to Broad Street\"), George Harrison (\"Somewhere in England\", \"Gone Troppo\", \"Brainwashed\") and Ringo Starr (\"Stop and Smell the Roses\").  He also played bass on \"Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds\".  By the end of the 1970s, Flowers had played bass on an estimated 500 hit recordings. Bassline: A bassline (also known as a bass line or bass part) is the term used in many styles of popular music, such as jazz, blues, funk, dub and electronic, or traditional music, for the low-pitched instrumental part or line played by a rhythm section instrument such as the electric bass, double bass, cello, tuba or keyboard (piano, Hammond organ, electric organ, or synthesizer).  It is also used sometimes in classical music.  In unaccompanied solo performance, basslines may simply be played in the lower register of any instrument such as guitar or piano while melody and/or further accompaniment is provided in the middle or upper register.  In solo music for piano and pipe organ, these instruments have an excellent lower register that can be used to play a deep bassline.  On organs, the bass line is typically played using the pedal keyboard and massive 16' and 32' bass pipes. Give My Regards to Broad Street (film): Give My Regards to Broad Street is a 1984 British musical drama film directed by Peter Webb, which starred Paul McCartney, Bryan Brown and Ringo Starr.  The film covers a fictional day in the life of Paul McCartney, who wrote the film for the screen, and McCartney, Starr and Linda McCartney all appeared as themselves.  Despite \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" being unsuccessful in the box office financially and critically, its soundtrack album sold well.  The title is a take on George M. Cohan's classic show tune \"Give My Regards to Broadway\" which made reference to London's Broad Street railway station, which would close in 1986.

    "question": "Based on the context: Chandrasekhar limit: The Chandrasekhar limit ( ) is the maximum mass of a stable white dwarf star.  The limit was first indicated in papers published by Wilhelm Anderson and E. C. Stoner, and was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Indian astrophysicist who independently discovered and improved upon the accuracy of the calculation in 1930, at the age of 19, in India.  This limit was initially ignored by the community of scientists because such a limit would logically require the existence of black holes, which were considered a scientific impossibility at the time.  White dwarfs resist gravitational collapse primarily through electron degeneracy pressure.  (By comparison, main sequence stars resist collapse through thermal pressure.)  The Chandrasekhar limit is the mass above which electron degeneracy pressure in the star's core is insufficient to balance the star's own gravitational self-attraction.  Consequently, white dwarfs with masses greater than the limit would be subject to further gravitational collapse, evolving into a different type of stellar remnant, such as a neutron star or black hole.  (However, white dwarfs generally avoid this fate by exploding before they undergo collapse.)  Those with masses under the limit remain stable as white dwarfs. Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor: In astrophysics, Chandrasekhar potential energy tensor provides the gravitational potential of a body due to its own gravity created by the distribution of matter across the body, named after the Indian American astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.  The Chandrasekhar tensor is a generalization of potential energy in other words, the trace of the Chandrasekhar tensor provides the potential energy of the body. Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit: In stellar astrophysics, the Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit is the maximum mass of a non-fusing, isothermal core that can support an enclosing envelope.  It is expressed as the ratio of the core mass to the total mass of the core and envelope.  Estimates of the limit depend on the models used and the assumed chemical compositions of the core and envelope; typical values given are from 0.10 to 0.15 (10% to 15% of the total stellar mass).  This is the maximum to which a helium-filled core can grow, and if this limit is exceeded, as can only happen in massive stars, the core collapses, releasing energy that causes the outer layers of the star to expand to become a red giant.  It is named after the astrophysicists Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Mario Schönberg, who estimated its value in a 1942 paper. Question: The Chandrasekhar limit was named after an astrophysicist, what is the name of his uncle of which is also a novel laureate?",

    "question": "Based on the context: Takanoyama Shuntarō: Takanoyama Shuntarō (born 21 February 1983 as Pavel Bojar) is a former sumo wrestler from Prague, Czech Republic.  He is the first man from the Czech Republic to join the professional sport in Japan.  He reached the third highest \"makushita\" division in 2004, but due to his light weight he had difficulty in regularly beating his opponents, despite his skill.  However, in May 2011 he finally earned promotion to the \"sekitori\" ranks.  After becoming only the third new \"sekitori\" since 1958 to pass through \"jūryō\" division in just one tournament, he made his debut in the top \"makuuchi\" division in September 2011.  He retired on 24 July 2014. Cardboard record: A cardboard record was a type of cheaply made phonograph record made of plastic-coated thin paperboard.  These discs were usually small, had poor audio quality compared to vinyl or acetate discs, and were often only marginally playable due to their light weight, slick surface, and tendency to warp like a taco shell.  Playability could be improved by placing a coin between the lock groove and the spindle hole to add weight and stability.  These records are distinct from both flexi discs, which are sturdier, and from many of the old home-recording discs since cardboard discs were mass-produced for a specific purpose. Al-Ca composite: Al-Ca composite is a high-conductivity, high-strength, lightweight composite consisting of sub-micron-diameter pure calcium metal filaments embedded inside a pure aluminium metal matrix.  The material is still in the development phase, but it has potential use as an overhead high-voltage power transmission conductor.  It could also be used wherever an exceptionally light, high-strength conductor is needed.  Its physical properties make it especially well-suited for DC transmission.  Compared with conventional conductors such as aluminium-conductor steel-reinforced cable (ACSR), all aluminium alloy conductors (AAAC), aluminium conductor alloy reinforced (ACAR), aluminium conductor composite reinforced ACCR and ACCC conductor that conduct AC current well and DC current somewhat less well (due to the skin effect), Al-Ca conductor is essentially a single uniform material with high DC conductivity, allowing the core strands and the outer strands of a conductor cable to all be the same wire type.  This conductor is inherently strong so that there is no need for a strong (usually poorly conductive) core to support its own weight as is done in conventional conductors.  This eliminates the \"bird caging\", spooling, and thermal fatigue problems caused by thermal expansion coefficient mismatch between the core and outer strands.  The Al-Ca phase interfaces strengthen the composite substantially, but do not have a noticeable effect on restricting the mean free path of electrons, which gives the composite both high strength and high conductivity, a combination that is normally difficult to achieve with both pure metals and alloys.  The high strength and light weight could reduce the number of towers needed per kilometer for long distance transmission lines.  Since towers and their foundations often account for 50% of a powerline's construction cost, building fewer towers would save a substantial fraction of total construction costs.  The high strength also could increase transmission reliability in wind/ice loading situations.  The high conductivity has the potential to reduce Ohmic losses.

    "question": "Based on the context: Factor analysis: Factor analysis is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors.  For example, it is possible that variations in six observed variables mainly reflect the variations in two unobserved (underlying) variables.  Factor analysis searches for such joint variations in response to unobserved latent variables.  The observed variables are modelled as linear combinations of the potential factors, plus \"error\" terms.  Factor analysis aims to find independent latent variables.  Followers of factor analytic methods believe that the information gained about the interdependencies between observed variables can be used later to reduce the set of variables in a dataset.  Factor analysis is commonly used in biology, psychometrics personality theories, marketing, product management, operations research and finance.  Users of factor analysis believe that it helps to deal with data sets where there are large numbers of observed variables that are thought to reflect a smaller number of underlying/latent variables.  It is one of the most commonly used inter-dependency techniques and is used when the relevant set of variables shows a systematic inter-dependence and the objective is to find out the latent factors that create a commonality. Oh, with the verbing!: Oh, with the verbing!  is a phrase commonly used in TV shows and movies, first used by comedian Jerry Lewis.

The Grand Lodge of Ohio follows the Anglo-American tradition of Freemasonry that is common in the United States.  In 2013, the Grand Lodge reported a total membership of 91,040. Masonic lodge: A Masonic lodge, often termed a private lodge or constituent lodge, is the basic organisational unit of Freemasonry.  It is also commonly, but erroneously, used as a term for a building in which such a unit meets.  Every new lodge must be warranted or chartered by a Grand Lodge, but is subject to its direction only in enforcing the published constitution of the jurisdiction.  By exception the three surviving lodges that formed the world's first known grand lodge in London (now merged into the United Grand Lodge of England) have the unique privilege to operate as \"time immemorial\", i.e., without such warrant; only one other lodge operates without a warrant – the Grand Stewards' Lodge in London, although it is not also entitled to the \"time immemorial\" title.  A Freemason is generally entitled to visit any Lodge in any jurisdiction (i.e., under any Grand Lodge) in amity with his own.  In some jurisdictions this privilege is restricted to Master Masons (that is, Freemasons who have attained the Order's third degree).  He is first usually required to check, and certify, the regularity of the relationship of the Lodge – and be able to satisfy that Lodge of his regularity of membership.  Freemasons gather together as a Lodge to work the three basic Degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason.

The Party, which had its roots in various earlier political movements, came together in the period immediately prior to the 1911 state election under the guidance of Sir John Forrest, the Federal member for Swan and former Premier of Western Australia, and other leading political figures in the State.  It was assembled in response to the solid organisation of the Labor Party and had the aim of assisting Ministerial members in winning seats and retaining power in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly.  The Party did not involve itself in Federal politics, although many of its members were also associated with the Commonwealth Liberal Party and assisted Liberal candidates and members from Western Australia in that capacity.  The massive defeat of the Ministerial faction by Labor in that election resulted in what remained of the faction formally joining the Liberal Party, which became the first organised non-Labor movement in the State and was a precursor to the Nationalist Party and, later, the modern Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division).

The Hutu Ten Commandments are often cited as a prime example of anti-Tutsi propaganda that was promoted by extremists in Rwanda following the 1990 invasion by the Rwandan Patriotic Front and prior to the 1994 Rwandan Genocide.  The chief editor of \"Kangura\", Hassan Ngeze, was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2003 by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment. The Tables of the Law: The Tables of the Law (\"Das Gesetz\") is a 1944 novella by German writer Thomas Mann.  It is a dramatic retelling of the Biblical story of Moses contained in the Book of Exodus, although some of the laws which Moses proscribes for his followers are taken from Leviticus.  It was the only story that Mann was ever commissioned to write, and he finished it in just eight weeks, beginning on January 18, 1943, and ending on March 13, 1943.  Publisher Armin L. Robinson, believing the Ten Commandments to be the basis on which civilization was founded, wanted to make a movie detailing the Nazi's \"desecration of the Mosaic Decalogue.\"  Instead, he settled on a book, entitled \"The Ten Commandments: Ten Short Novels of Hitler's War Against the Moral Code,\" with ten authors, one for each commandment.  Mann's novella, which he was paid $1000 to write, was originally meant to be the introduction to the volume, but Robinson liked it so much that he decided to make it the first story, under the heading \"Thou Shalt Have No Other God Before Me.\"  It should also be noted that Mann considered his story to be greatly superior to that of his fellow contributors, and he considered the overall book a \"failure\". Ten Commandments in Catholic theology: The Ten Commandments are a series of religious and moral imperatives that are recognized as a moral foundation in several of the Abrahamic religions, including Catholicism.  As described in the Old Testament books Exodus and Deuteronomy, the Commandments form part of a covenant offered by God to the Israelites to free them from the spiritual slavery of sin.  According to the \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\"—the official exposition of the Catholic Church's Christian beliefs—the Commandments are considered essential for spiritual good health and growth, and serve as the basis for Catholic social justice.

    "question": "Based on the context: Operation Breakthrough (program): Operation Breakthrough, an anti-poverty movement, was established in Durham, North Carolina in August 1964.  It played a prominent and influential role in the expansion of the Civil Rights movement in Durham.  Terry Sanford, its founder, managed to develop that through the help and involvement of the North Carolina Fund.  A Member of the Democratic Party, Sanford was the former governor of North Carolina and was highly respected for his intervention in the improvement of public education.  Indeed, in the 1960s, the education system in place in North Carolina was very poor as one quarter of the adults above 25 years old had received an education inferior to sixth grade, making most of them illiterate.  Because of the high success of the program, the concept developed through the North Carolina Fund was mimicked throughout the nation, transforming what initially was a state wide program to a national program.  Throughout this movement, activism played a fundamental role as the main aim of the program consisted in changing the economic situation of a state through the use of political and social power. Welcome to Durham, USA: Welcome to Durham, USA is a documentary about gang violence in Durham, North Carolina. Louis Austin: Louis Austin (1898-1971) was an African American journalist, leader and social activist.  Austin purchased \"The Carolina Times\" in 1927 and transformed it into an institution that aided African Americans in their fight for freedom and equality in North Carolina.  He used a new approach to Civil Rights issues in Durham, incorporating lower and middle class blacks, unlike the moderate, accommodationist approach of the black elite in Durham during this time.  Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change.  Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern Civil Rights Movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active.  His strategies—which were once considered too radical by his peers—allowed Austin to maintain his influence in Durham well into the 1950s and 1960s.  In doing so, Austin created a lasting impact for Durham. Question: Are the documentaries Welcome to Durham, USA and The Agronomist both about Durham, North Carolina?",

    "question": "Based on the context: The Society of Floristry Limited: The Society of Floristry Limited was formed in 1951 to meet the growing need for professional recognition for florists. Its first major task, after forming a Council of directors composed of leading florists in the industry, was to write, run and mark examinations in floristry skills and theory, which it did successfully for almost 49 years.  It developed into an educational and standard-setting body which pioneered the concept of floristry as a profession, running regular workshops and educational seminars for florists undertaking study and continuing professional development.  The Society also ran a highly successful trade show for many years, enabling the best exponents of the craft to showcase their skills and talents, and for the support industries in the trade to launch and promote their product.  These shows were attended by thousands of florists and students over the years, raising standards and pushing back the boundaries of commercial floral design.  The cornerstone of the success of the Society was the ability of training providers to draw down Government funding for courses which supported what became the gold standard qualifications in the UK for florists, the Intermediate Certificate of the Society of Floristry (ICSF) and the National Diploma of the Society of Floristry (NDSF).  When the ability to draw this funding was removed a few years ago in an initiative to reduce the number of organisations awarding recognised qualifications, the number of florists able to afford to attend colleges and the ability of those colleges to offer courses toward the examinations was severely restricted.  As a consequence, the number coming forward to be examined dropped off significantly, and the pass rate amongst those who did fell also.  The Society did not want to see a situation develop where its standards were eroded, and entered into negotiations with NPTC City and Guilds to write recognised qualifications at Higher Education level to replace the well-recognised and valued ICSF and NDSF.  The courses came into existence during 2006 - see http://www.nptc.org.uk/qualifications/default.asp?area=130.  This had a number of advantages for candidates: Colleges were funded so courses were available and more affordable; college support for learning needs could be accessed; the standards and skills required became more transparent and accessible.  However, the result for the Society was that its reason for existing was seriously eroded.  On 28.2.10 the Society ceased trading and was acquired and absorbed into the British Florist Association.

The species exhibits an extreme degree of cryptobiosis – the ability of a life form to enter a non-metabolic state, extending life indefinitely. Yelovichnus: Yelovichnus is an \"enigmatic\" genus known from fossils of the Ediacaran period.  \"Yelovichnus\" was originally believed to be an ichnotaxon: its fossils, because of their \"meandering nature\", were initially thought to be feeding trails left by other life forms, such as annelids or mollusks.  Better-preserved specimens later demonstrated that the fossils were not true feeding trails, as there was no evidence of turning by the life form that supposedly left them.  The fossils are now recognized as belonging to an organism taking the form of \"collapsed, segmented tubes\", possibly an alga or a protist.  It has also been argued that \"Yelovichnus\" and similar organisms are xenophyophores, large but single-cellular organisms that exist today in the abyssal zone.  Due to similar structures found in their fossils, it is theorized that \"Yelovichnus\" may be related to \"Palaeopascichnus\", as well as \"Aspidella\" and \"Neonereites\".  The main difference between \"Yelovichnus\" and \"Palaeopasicichnus\" is the shape of their segments: the segments of \"Yelovichnus\" took the shape of \"closed, ovate-shaped loops\", whereas the segments of \"Palaeopascichnus\" were quite varied in shape. Platystemon: Platystemon is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the poppy family containing the single species Platystemon californicus, which is known by the common name creamcups.  It is native to Oregon, California, Arizona, Utah and Baja California, and is found in open grasslands and sandy soils.

It was also the most recent Atlantic hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 until Hurricane Irma in 2017.  It was the sixth named storm, second hurricane, and second Category 5 hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season.  Felix formed from a tropical wave on August 31, passing through the southern Windward Islands on September 1 before strengthening to attain hurricane status.  A day later it rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane, and early on September 3 it was upgraded to Category 5 status; by 2100 UTC, the hurricane was downgraded to Category 4 status, but was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane for the second and final time by the morning of September 4.

Garibaldi is the son of Marco Garibaldi and Priscilla Presley, and also half-brother of Lisa Marie Presley. Finnish gunboat Hämeenmaa: Hämeenmaa was a gunboat that served in the Finnish Navy during World War II.  She was built in 1917.  As the ship had changed hands many times during the turbulent last years of World War I she had been renamed many times: In Russian service, she was called \"Pingvin\", later, in German service, her name was \"Wulf\".  Finally the Germans handed her over to the Finns in 1920, who renamed her \"Hämeenmaa\".  After World War II, she served as a trawler in the Baltic Sea.  She was scrapped in 1953. Crosswind kite power: Crosswind kite power is power derived from a class of airborne wind-energy conversion systems (AWECS, aka AWES) or crosswind kite power systems (CWKPS) characterized by a kite system that has energy-harvesting parts that fly transverse to the direction of the ambient wind, i.e., to crosswind mode; sometimes the entire wing set and tether set is flown in crosswind mode.  These systems at many scales from toy to power-grid-feeding sizes may be used as high-altitude wind power (HAWP) devices or low-altitude wind power (LAWP) devices without having to use towers.  Flexible wings or rigid wings may be used in the kite system.  A tethered wing, flying in crosswind at many times wind speed, harvests wind power from an area that is many times exceeding the wing’s own area.  Crosswind kite power systems have some advantages over conventional wind turbines: access to more powerful and stable wind resource, high capacity factor, capability for deployment on and offshore at comparable costs, and no need for a tower.  Additionally, the wings of the CWKPS may vary in aerodynamic efficiency; the movement of crosswinding tethered wings is sometimes compared with the outer parts of conventional wind turbine blades.  However, a conventional traverse-to-wind rotating blade set carried aloft in a kite-power system has the blade set cutting to crosswind and is a form of crosswind kite power.  Miles L. Loyd furthered studies on crosswind kite power systems in his work \"Crosswind Kite Power\" in 1980.  Some believe that crosswind kite power was introduced by P. Payne and C. McCutchen in their patent No. 3,987,987, filed in 1975, however, crosswind kite power was used far before such patent, e.g., in target kites for war-target practice where the crosswinding power permitted high speeds to give practice to gunners.

    "question": "Based on the context: Louis le Brocquy Táin illustrations: In 1967 Louis le Brocquy was commissioned by the publisher Liam Miller to illustrate Thomas Kinsella's inspired version of the Táin Bó Cúailnge, the dramatic record of Ireland's proto-historic past.  Ailbhe Ní Bhriain remarks: 'The Táin Bó Cuailnge - táin, meaning the gathering of people for a cattle raid - is a prose epic with verse passages and forms the centrepiece of the cycle of Ulster heroic stories.  It tells of the exploits of King Conchobar and his chief warrior Cúchulainn (\"The Hound of Ulster\") and of the invasion of Ulster by Queen Medb of Connacht in an attempt to capture the Brown Bull of Cuailgne.  Dating as far back as the 12th century in manuscript form, this legend has been treated both academically by scholars and linguists and romantically by such Revival writers as Yeats and Lady Gregory.  The Dolmen Edition of the saga was to give, in Kinsella's words, the first \"living version of the story\", a version true to its blunt and brutal Gaelic character.'  Louis le Brocquy paints several hundred calligraphic brush drawings over a period of six months retaining 133 illustrations.  The artist will note: 'Any graphic accompaniment to a story which owes its existence to the memory and concern of a people over some twelve hundred years, should decently be as impersonal as possible.  The illustrations of early Celtic manuscripts express not personality but temperament.  They provide not graphic comment on the text but an extension of it.  Their means are not available to us today - either temperamentally or technically - but certain lessons may be learned from them relevant to the present work.  In particular they suggest that graphic images, if any, should grow spontaneously and even physically from the matter of the printed text.  If these images - these marks in printer's ink - form an extension to Thomas Kinsella's Táin, they are a humble one.  It is as shadows thrown by the text that they derive their substance.' Findabair: Findabair or Finnabair (modern Irish Fionnabhair ] ) was a daughter of Ailill and Queen Medb of Connacht in Irish mythology.  The meaning of the name is \"white phantom\" (etymologically cognate with \"Gwenhwyfar\", the original Welsh form of Guinevere).  The Dindsenchas also mention a Findabair that is the daughter of Lugaid Laigde. Táin Bó Cúailnge: Táin Bó Cúailnge (] ; \"the driving-off of cows of Cooley\", commonly known as The Cattle Raid of Cooley or The Táin) is a legendary tale from early Irish literature, often considered an epic, although it is written primarily in prose rather than verse.  It tells of a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, who intend to steal the stud bull Donn Cuailnge, opposed only by the teenage Ulster hero Cú Chulainn.

    "question": "Based on the context: Heichū Monogatari: Tales of Heichū (Heichū monogatari) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries.  As early as the \"Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\" (\"Manyōshū\"), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations.  The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time.  People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion.  Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's composition.  The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the \"Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry\" (Kokinshū), the first imperial poetry collection, which was completed around 905.  By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold, and \"Tales of Ise\" (Ise monogatari), \"Tales of Heichū\", and \"Tales of Yamato\" (Yamato monogatari) seem to have emerged at about this same time.  Also, the second imperial poetry collection, \"Collection of Later Poetry\" (Gosenshū), commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter, has many narrative qualities.  The only extant manuscript of \"Tales of Heichū\" is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period (1185–1333), some three hundred years after the work's probable date of composition.

    "question": "Based on the context: Chicago film industry: The Chicago film industry is a central hub for motion picture production and exhibition that was established before Hollywood became the undisputed capital of film making.  In the early 1900s, Chicago boasted the greatest number of production companies and filmmakers.  Essanay Studios founded by George K. Spoor was one of the earliest successful studios to produce movies in Chicago, employing stars such as Charlie Chaplin and Gloria Swanson.  Actor and co-founder of Essanay Studios \"Broncho Billie\" Anderson gave birth to the western genre.  Early film companies such as Essanay Studios produced multiple silent films every week and rented viewing equipment to showcase the latest cinematography to the public.  This rental culture gave birth to the popularity of Nickelodeons up until the Great Depression.  However, due to the high demand for motion pictures during this time, a black market for films and equipment developed.  The Motion Picture Patents Company, established in 1909 as a conglomerate of the major studios, sought to eliminate all illegal use of patented film equipment.  As a result, independent ventures entered the film scene.  Independents drove the film industry to the west to avoid legal trouble with the trust of major film companies united under the Motion Picture Patents Company.  The west offered fairer weather and scenery that better accommodated film making.  Not until the 1980s and early 21st century has Chicago experienced a film production revival.  Blockbusters, such as \"Blues Brothers\", \"Sixteen Candles\", and \"The Dark Knight\", have rejuvenated the Chicago film scene.  In the 21st century, Chicago further experienced a film revival due to a tax bill the state of Illinois passed to give filmmakers a 30% tax break on production costs.

    "question": "Based on the context: Ethanol: Ethanol, also called alcohol, ethyl alcohol, and drinking alcohol, is a compound and simple alcohol with the chemical formula C2H5OH .  Its formula can be written also as CH3 −CH2 −OH or C2H5 −OH (an ethyl group linked to a hydroxyl group), and is often abbreviated as EtOH.  Ethanol is a volatile, flammable, colorless liquid with a slight characteristic odor.  It is used as a drug and is the principal type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks. Alcohol congener analysis: Alcohol congener analysis of blood and urine is used to provide an indication of the type of alcoholic beverage consumed.  The analysis involves investigating compounds called congeners that give the beverage a distinctive appearance, aroma, and flavour, not including water and ethanol.  The theory of discovering one’s drinking habits has been investigated since the late 1970s, predominantly in Germany, for \"hip-flask\" defence type cases (after-drinking).  Alcohol congener analysis can play a crucial role in these cases where the driver is apprehended some time after a motor vehicle incident who, when returning a positive alcohol reading then claim that this is due to drinking an alcoholic beverage only after the incident.  This traditional methodology for congener analysis has focused solely on the detection of fermentation by-product congeners that are found in all alcoholic beverages.  By comparing the ratios of a set standard of congeners, the ingested alcoholic beverage type is proposed. Legal drinking age: The legal drinking age is the age at which a person can legally consume or purchase alcoholic beverages.  These laws cover a wide range of issues and behaviors, addressing when and where alcohol can be consumed.  The minimum age alcohol can be legally consumed can be different from the age when it can be purchased in some countries.  These laws vary among different countries and many laws have exemptions or special circumstances.  Most laws apply only to drinking alcohol in public places, with alcohol consumption in the home being mostly unregulated (an exception being the UK, which has a minimum legal age of five for supervised consumption in private places).  Some countries also have different age limits for different types of alcoholic drinks.

    "question": "Based on the context: Supremacy Clause: The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution (Article VI, Clause 2) establishes that the Constitution, federal laws made pursuant to it, and treaties made under its authority, constitute the supreme law of the land.  It provides that state courts are bound by the supreme law; in case of conflict between federal and state law, the federal law must be applied.  Even state constitutions are subordinate to federal law.  In essence, it is a conflict-of-laws rule specifying that certain national acts take priority over any state acts that conflict with national law.  In this respect, the Supremacy Clause follows the lead of Article XIII of the Articles of Confederation, which provided that \"Every State shall abide by the determination of the United States in Congress Assembled, on all questions which by this confederation are submitted to them.\"  A constitutional provision announcing the supremacy of federal law, the Supremacy Clause assumes the underlying priority of federal authority, at least when that authority is expressed in the Constitution itself.  No matter what the federal government or the states might wish to do, they have to stay within the boundaries of the Constitution.  This makes the Supremacy Clause the cornerstone of the whole American political structure. Children's Health Insurance Program: The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) – formerly known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) – is a program administered by the United States Department of Health and Human Services that provides matching funds to states for health insurance to families with children.  The program was designed to cover uninsured children in families with incomes that are modest but too high to qualify for Medicaid. Title X: The Title X Family Planning Program, officially known as Public Law 91-572 or “Population Research and Voluntary Family Planning Programs”, was enacted under President Richard Nixon in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act.  Title X is the only federal grant program dedicated solely to providing individuals with comprehensive family planning and related preventive health services.  Title X is legally designed to prioritize the needs of low-income families or uninsured people (including those who are not eligible for Medicaid) who might not otherwise have access to these health care services.  These services are provided to low-income and uninsured individuals at reduced or no cost.  Its overall purpose is to promote positive birth outcomes and healthy families by allowing individuals to decide the number and spacing of their children.  The other health services provided in Title X-funded clinics are integral in achieving this objective.

The channel was also localised for thirty markets to include international, national and local news, as well as weather updates. Spliced (TV series): Spliced is a Canadian animated television series produced by Teletoon and Nelvana.  The series made its world premiere on Jetix in Latin America on April 20, 2009.  The series has aired in Canada on Teletoon, in the United States on Qubo, in Australia on ABC3, in the United Kingdom on Nicktoons, in Latin America on Disney XD, and in Sweden on Nickelodeon.

    "question": "Based on the context: Highly charged ion: Highly charged ions (HCI) are ions in very high charge states due to the loss of many or most of their bound electrons by energetic collisions or high-energy photon absorption.  Examples are 13-fold ionized iron, Fe or Fe (XIV) in spectroscopic notation, found in the Sun's corona, or \"naked\" uranium, U, bare all bound electrons, which requires very high energy for its production.  HCI are found in stellar coronae, in active galactic nuclei, in supernova remnants, and in accretion disks. Most of the visible matter found in the universe consists of highly charged ions .  High temperature plasmas used for nuclear fusion energy research also contain HCI generated by the plasma-wall interaction (see Tokamak).  In the laboratory, HCI are investigated by means of heavy ion particle accelerators and electron beam ion traps. Ion chromatography: Ion chromatography (or ion-exchange chromatography) is a chromatography process that separates ions and polar molecules based on their affinity to the ion exchanger.  It works on almost any kind of charged molecule—including large proteins, small nucleotides, and amino acids.  The two types of ion chromatography are anion-exchange and cation-exchange.  It is often used in protein purification, water analysis, and quality control.  The water-soluble and charged molecules such as proteins, amino acids, and peptides bind to moieties which are oppositely charged by forming ionic bonds to the insoluble stationary phase.  The equilibrated stationary phase consists of an ionizable functional group where the targeted molecules of a mixture to be separated and quantified can bind while passing through the column—a cationic stationary phase is used to separate anions and an anionic stationary phase is used to separate cations.  Cation exchange chromatography is used when the desired molecules to separate are cations and anion exchange chromatography is used to separate anions.  The bound molecules then can be eluted and collected using an eluant which contains anions and cations by running higher concentration of ions through the column or changing pH of the column.  One of the primary advantages for the use of ion chromatography is only one interaction involved during the separation as opposed to other separation techniques; therefore, ion chromatography may have higher matrix tolerance.  However, there are also disadvantages involved when performing ion-exchange chromatography, such as constant evolution with the technique which leads to the inconsistency from column to column. Platypus venom: The platypus is one of the few living mammals to produce venom.  Males have a pair of spurs on their hind limbs that secrete venom that is only seasonally active to breeding season, supporting the theory that the use of venom is for competition of mates only, not protection.  While the spur remains available for defense outside of breeding season, the platypus's venom gland lacks secretion.  While the after effects are described as excruciatingly painful, this venom is not lethal to humans. Question: The Oxus cobra contains what kind of ions for their venom to be active?",

    "question": "Based on the context: Fashionable Nonsense: Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science (French: \"Impostures Intellectuelles\" ), published in the UK as Intellectual Impostures, is a book by physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont.  Sokal is best known for the Sokal Affair, in which he submitted a deliberately absurd article to \"Social Text\", a critical theory journal, and was able to get it published. Nairi Sedrakyan: Nairi Sedrakyan (born 1961 in Ninotsminda, USSR) is an Armenian mathematician involved in national and international Olympiads of mathematics, having been the president of Armenian Mathematics Olympiads, the Leader of Armenian IMO Team, jury member and problem selection committee member of International Mathematical Olympiad, jury member and problem selection committee member of Zhautykov International Mathematical Olympiad (ZIMO), jury member and problem selection committee member of the 1st International Olympiad of Metropolises, the president of International Mathematical Olympiad Tournament of the Towns in Armenia.  He has also authored a large number of problems proposed in these Olympiads.  Nairi Sedrakyan is the author of one of the hardest problems ever proposed in the history of International Mathematical Olympiad, 5th problem of 37th International Mathematical Olympiad.  This problem is considered as one of the hardest problems ever, because none of the members of the strongest teams, i.e. National Olympic Teams of the USA, Russia or China has succeeded to solve it correctly.  Moreover, the National Olympic Team of People's Republic of China has obtained a cumulative result equal to 0 points and was ranked the 6th in the final ranking of the countries instead of the usual 1st or 2nd place.  The British 2014 film X+Y, released in the USA as A Brilliant Young Mind, inspired by, Beautiful Young Minds focuses on an English mathematical genius chosen to represent the United Kingdom at the IMO.  In the film this problem is stated to be the hardest problem ever proposed in the history of International Mathematical Olympiad (minutes 9:40-10:30).  Other outstanding results of the author are having 4 problems in the Shortlist of the worldwide selected 27 problems of the 40th IMO (1999) in Romania and having 5 medals winner students in 41st IMO in South Korea, i.e. 2 silver medals and 3 bronze medals.  Moreover, only 1 point was missing for Sevak Mkrtchyan to obtain a Gold Medal (currently he is an assistant professor of mathematics in United States, Sevak received his PhD in mathematics from University of California, Berkley).  Nevertheless, Arthur Barkhoudarian, one of the first students of Nairi Sedrakyan has received a Gold Medal in International Mathematical Olympiad, later on Arthur received his PhD degree in mathematics from Charles University in Prague.  As all winner students were from the same school, where Nairi Sedrakyan was teaching mathematics, the government of the Republic of Armenia gave to the author the title of the best teacher of the Republic of Armenia and he received a special gift from the Prime Minister. Alan Sokal: Alan David Sokal ( ; born January 24, 1955) is a professor of mathematics at University College London and professor of physics at New York University.  He works in statistical mechanics and combinatorics.  He is best known to the wider public for his criticism of postmodernism, after the Sokal affair in 1996 when his deliberately nonsensical paper was published by Duke University's \"Social Text\".  He also works to counter faulty scientific reasoning, as seen with his involvement in criticising the critical positivity ratio concept in positive psychology.

    "question": "Based on the context: Joseph Martin (general): Joseph Martin (1740–1808) was a brigadier general in the Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War, in which Martin's frontier diplomacy with the Cherokee people is credited with not only averting Indian attacks on the Scotch-Irish American and English American settlers who helped win the battles of Kings Mountain and Cowpens, but with also helping to keep the Indians' position neutral and from siding with the British troops during those crucial battles.  Historians agree that the settlers' success at these two battles signaled the turning of the tide of the Revolutionary War—in favor of the Americans. Hindenburg Programme: The Hindenburg Programme of August 1916 is the name given to the armaments and economic policy begun in late 1916 by the Third \"Oberste Heeresleitung\" (\"OHL\", the German General Staff), Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff.  The two were appointed after the sacking of General Erich von Falkenhayn on 28 August 1916 and intended to double German industrial production, greatly to increase the output of munitions and weapons. Operation Michael: Operation \"Michael\" was a major German military offensive during the First World War that began the Spring Offensive on 21 March 1918.  It was launched from the Hindenburg Line, in the vicinity of Saint-Quentin, France.  Its goal was to break through the Allied (Entente) lines and advance in a north-westerly direction to seize the Channel ports, which supplied the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and to drive the BEF into the sea.  Two days later General Ludendorff, the Chief of the German General Staff, changed his plan and pushed for an offensive due west, along the whole of the British front north of the River Somme.  This was designed to separate the French and British Armies and crush the British forces by pushing them into the sea.  The offensive ended at Villers-Bretonneux, to the east of the Allied communications centre at Amiens, where the Allies managed to halt the German advance; the German Armies had suffered many casualties and were unable to maintain supplies to the advancing troops.

The descendants of Kristinas Astikas, a Lithuanian and a close associate of the 14th century Lithuanian ruler Vytautas, were highly prominent for centuries, first in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Kingdom of Prussia.  The family has produced many individuals notable in Lithuanian, Belarusian, Polish, German (particularly Prussian) and general European history and culture.  The Radziwiłł family received the title of \"Reichsfürst\" (prince, Polish: \"książę\" , Lithuanian: \"kunigaikštis\" , Belarusian: князь, kniaź ), from the Holy Roman Empire.

The first settlers tried to preserve their shamanistic religion and sought asylum amongst the non-Christian Lithuanians.  Towards the end of the 14th century, another wave of Tatars – this time, Muslims, were invited into the Grand Duchy by Vytautas the Great.  These Tatars first settled in Lithuania proper around Vilnius, Trakai, Hrodna and Kaunas and later spread to other parts of the Grand Duchy that later became part of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  These areas comprise present-day Lithuania, Belarus and Poland.  From the very beginning of their settlement in Lithuania they were known as the Lipka Tatars.  While maintaining their religion, they united their fate with that of the mainly Christian Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  From the Battle of Grunwald onwards the Lipka Tatar light cavalry regiments participated in every significant military campaign of Lithuania and Poland. Union of Lublin: The Union of Lublin (Polish: \"unia lubelska\" ; Lithuanian: \"Liublino unija\" ) was signed July 1, 1569, in Lublin, Poland, and created a single state, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.  It replaced the personal union of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania with a real union and an elective monarchy, since Sigismund II Augustus, the last of the Jagiellons, remained childless after three marriages.  In addition, the autonomy of Royal Prussia was largely abandoned.  The Duchy of Livonia, tied to Lithuania in real union since the Union of Grodno (1566), became a Polish–Lithuanian condominium.

Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole.  The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year.  The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October.  It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

This crater was first visited by the Mars Exploration Rover \"Opportunity\".  It is roughly 730 metres wide, nearly eight times the size of the crater Endurance, visited by \"Opportunity\" from sols 951 to 1630.  It is informally named after \"Victoria\" – one of the five ships of Ferdinand Magellan and the first ship to circumnavigate the globe – and formally named after Victoria, Seychelles.  Along the edges of the crater are many outcrops within recessed alcoves and promontories, named for bays and capes that Magellan discovered. Terby (crater): Terby is a crater on the northern edge of Hellas Planitia, Mars.  It is in the Iapygia quadrangle. The 174 km diameter crater is centered at 28°S, 73°E with an elevation of −5 km.  It is named after François J. Terby.  It is the site of an ancient lakebed and has clay deposits.  Using data from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter missions researchers believe Terby's layers were formed from sediments settling under water.  Crater counts show this happened during the Noachian period.  It used to be thought that Terby Crater contained a large delta.  However, newer observations have led researchers to think of the layered sequence as part of a group of layers that may have extended all the across Hellas.  There is no valley large enough at the northern rim of Terby to have carried the large amount of sediments necessary to produce the layers.  Other details in the layers argue against Terby containing a delta.  Fan deposits are some of the thickest on Mars.  Hydrated minerals, including Fe/Mg phyllosilicates, have been detected in several layers. Take On Mars: Take On Mars is a simulation video game for Windows, developed by Bohemia Interactive.

Anatomy murder: An anatomy murder (sometimes called burking in British English) is a murder committed in order to use all or part of the cadaver for medical research or teaching.  It is not a medicine murder because the body parts are not believed to have any medicinal use in themselves.  The motive for the murder is created by the demand for cadavers for dissection, and the opportunity to learn anatomy and physiology as a result of the dissection.  Rumors concerning the prevalence of anatomy murders are associated with the rise in demand for cadavers in research and teaching produced by the Scientific Revolution.  During the 19th century, the sensational serial murders associated with Burke and Hare and the London Burkers led to legislation which provided scientists and medical schools with legal ways of obtaining cadavers.  Rumors persist that anatomy murders are carried out wherever there is a high demand for cadavers.  These rumors, like those concerning organ theft, are hard to substantiate, and may reflect continued, deep-held fears of the use of cadavers as commodities.

    "question": "Based on the context: Vegetation classification: Vegetation classification is the process of classifying and mapping the vegetation over an area of the earth's surface.  Vegetation classification is often performed by state based agencies as part of land use, resource and environmental management.  Many different methods of vegetation classification have been used.  In general, there has been a shift from structural classification used by forestry for the mapping of timber resources, to floristic community mapping for biodiversity management.  Whereas older forestry-based schemes considered factors such as height, species and density of the woody canopy, floristic community mapping shifts the emphasis onto ecological factors such as climate, soil type and floristic associations.  Classification mapping is usually now done using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software. Vegetation and slope stability: Vegetation and slope stability are interrelated by the ability of the plant life growing on slopes to both promote and hinder the stability of the slope.  The relationship is a complex combination of the type of soil, the rainfall regime, the plant species present, the slope aspect, and the steepness of the slope.  Knowledge of the underlying slope stability as a function of the soil type, its age, horizon development, compaction, and other impacts is a major underlying aspect of understanding how vegetation can alter the stability of the slope.  There are four major ways in which vegetation influences slope stability: wind throwing, the removal of water, mass of vegetation (surcharge), and mechanical reinforcement of roots. Pavonia (plant): Pavonia is a genus of flowering plants in the mallow family, Malvaceae.  The generic name honours Spanish botanist José Antonio Pavón Jiménez (1754–1844).

When Jarvis left the show in 1951, film star Eddie Albert took his place and co-hosted with White for six months until thirty-three and a half hours of live ad-lib television per week, featuring just the two of them, took its toll and he also resigned.  White was then hosting the show alone, and is believed to have been the first female television talk show host as a result.  After a period of White talking directly into the camera lens for hours at a stretch, the show began accepting guests to interact with her as well as gradually incorporating scripts and sketches.  Similarly to Jackie Gleason's \"Honeymooners\" sketches on the Dumont Network during the same era, recurring sketches involving White as a housewife named Elizabeth caught on with the viewers to the point that expanding the sketches into a half-hour sitcom appeared to be the obvious next step.  Series pianist George Tibbles began writing the sketches.  Studio producer Don Fedderson, Tibbles and White formed a production company called \"Bandy Productions,\" named after Betty White's dog Bandit, and White changed over to a half hour sitcom format based on the Elizabeth sketches entitled \"Life With Elizabeth\", which ran in syndication for two years and sixty-five episodes.  Across the decades, White would use the skills she had honed on \"Hollywood on Television\" by hosting her own talk show in 1954 and subsequent variety series as well as starring in numerous sitcoms, including \"Date with the Angels\", \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"The Betty White Show\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Golden Palace\" and \"Hot in Cleveland\", as well as hosting the 2012 prank show \"Betty White's Off Their Rockers\", which began airing 63 years after the premiere of \"Hollywood on Television\".

The show was produced at WCVB-TV by Jonathan Goodson Productions, and all of its games and its theme were virtually identical to the Illinois state lottery game show \"Illinois Instant Riches\" (later \"Illinois Luckiest\"). List of six-number lottery games: A six-number lottery game, often having Megabucks, Pick-6, or Lotto as part of its name, is a form of lottery in which six numbers are drawn from a larger pool (for example, 6 out of 44).  Winning the top prize, usually a jackpot, requires a player to match all six regular numbers drawn; the order in which they are drawn is irrelevant.  Functionally, these games are similar to five-number games, except, because of the sixth number that needs to be matched, the top-prize odds usually are longer.  Therefore, six-number games generally offer a higher top prize.  Six-number games (using one drum) were the most popular kind of U.S. lottery game, before two-drum games such as Cash4Life and Mega Millions were created.  (These games also draw six numbers; however, five are from one set, while a sixth is drawn from a second pool.

Before European settlement, Codornices probably had no direct, permanent connection to San Francisco Bay.  Like many other small creeks, it filtered through what early maps show as grassland to a large, northward-running salt marsh and slough that also carried waters from Marin Creek and Schoolhouse Creek.  A channel was cut through in the 19th Century, and Codornices flows directly to San Francisco Bay by way of a narrow remnant slough adjacent to Golden Gate Fields racetrack.

    "question": "Based on the context: Adaptive unconscious: The adaptive unconscious, first coined by Daniel Wagner in 2002, is described as a series of mental processes that is able to affect judgement and decision making, but is out of reach of the conscious mind.  Architecturally, the adaptive unconscious is said to be unreachable because it is buried in an unknown part of the brain.  This type of thinking evolved earlier than the conscious mind, enabling the mind to transform information and think in ways that enhance an organism's survival.  It can be described as a quick sizing up of the world which interprets information and decides how to act very quickly and outside the conscious view.  The adaptive unconscious is active in everyday activities such as learning new material, detecting patterns, and filtering information.  It is also characterized by being unconscious, unintentional, uncontrollable, and efficient without requiring cognitive tools.  Lacking the need for cognitive tools does not make the adaptive unconscious any less useful than the conscious mind as the adaptive unconscious allows for processes like memory formation, physical balancing, language, learning, and some emotional and personalities processes that includes judgement, decision making, impression formation, evaluations, and goal pursuing.  Despite being useful, the series of processes of the adaptive unconscious will not always result in accurate or correct decisions by the organism.  The adaptive unconscious is affected by things like emotional reaction, estimations, and experience and is thus inclined to stereotyping and schema which can lead to inaccuracy in decision making.  The adaptive conscious does however help decision making to eliminate cognitive biases such as prejudice because of its lack of cognitive tools. Syzygium jambos: Syzygium jambos is a tree originating in Southeast Asia and occurring widely elsewhere, having been introduced as an ornamental and fruit tree.

    "question": "Based on the context: Barossa Valley (wine): The Barossa Valley wine region is one of Australia's oldest wine regions.  Located in South Australia, the Barossa Valley is about 56 km (35 miles) northeast of the city of Adelaide.  Unlike most of Australia whose wine industry was heavily influenced by the British, the wine industry of the Barossa Valley was founded by German settlers fleeing persecution from the Prussian province of Silesia (in what is now Poland).  The hot continental climate of the region promoted the production of very ripe grapes that was the linchpin of the early Australian fortified wine industry.  As the modern Australian wine industry shifted towards red table wines (particularly those made by the prestigious Cabernet Sauvignon) in the mid-20th century, the Barossa Valley fell out of favor due to its reputation for being largely a Syrah from producers whose grapes were destined for blending.  During this period the name \"Barossa Valley\" rarely appeared on wine labels.  In the 1980s, the emergence of several boutique families specializing in old vine Shiraz wines began to capture international attention for the distinctive style of Barossa Shiraz, a full bodied red wine with rich chocolate and spice notes.  This led to a renaissance in the Barossa Valley which catapulted the region to the forefront of the Australian wine industry. Act of 5th November: The Act of 5th November of 1916 was a declaration of Emperors Wilhelm II of Germany and Franz Joseph of Austria.  This act promised the creation of the Kingdom of Poland out of territory of Congress Poland, envisioned by its authors as a puppet state controlled by the Central Powers.  The origin of that document was the dire need to draft new recruits from German-occupied Poland for the war with Russia.  Even though the act itself expressed very little in concrete terms, its declaration is regarded as one of main factors in the Polish efforts to regain independence.  Despite official statements, the German Empire really planned to annex up to 35,000 km² of prewar Congress Poland, with ethnic cleansing of between 2 and 3 million Poles and Jews out of these territories to make room for German settlers. German Namibians: German Namibians (German: \"Deutschnamibier\" ) are a community of people descended from ethnic German colonists who settled in present-day Namibia.  In 1883, the German trader Adolf Lüderitz bought (from a local chief) what would become the southern coast of Namibia and founded the city of Lüderitz.  The German government, eager to gain overseas possessions, annexed the territory soon after, naming it South West Africa (German: \"Deutsch-Südwestafrika\" ).  Small numbers of Germans subsequently immigrated there, many coming as soldiers (German: \"Schutztruppe\" ), traders, diamond miners, or colonial officials.  In 1915, during the course of World War I, Germany lost Southwest Africa (see History of Namibia); after the war, the former colony became a South African mandate.  The German settlers were allowed to remain and, until independence in 1990, German remained an official language of the territory. Question: What was the royal title of the man whose German government backed the colonization of Poland by German settlers, one ofthe factors leading to the plight of rural Poland which was the focus of the novel The Outpost?",
