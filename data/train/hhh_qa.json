Another question is “whether it should be illegal”, and I’m not sure what’s meant by that.  The laws about religion are very complicated and country-specific.  In the United States, one of the major things that happen when a religion is labeled as a “cult” is that the group gets access to federal money that’s supposed to be used for people who get “turned away from” other religions, or don’t have a religion at all.  The US government only gives money to religious groups that it decides are “good for the country”.  The US Supreme Court ruled in 1990 that this was an acceptable basis for giving federal money, since it was “a reasonable means of carrying out the government’s proper role” of protecting the public welfare.  There are some examples of Mormon groups that the US government has funded as a result of this, but in general it’s only given to religious groups that have",

If you take the brake line, and twist it, it will get stuck in the wheel cylinder.  And then it won't work!  So if someone tried to get rid of the brake line, they would have to take it out of the car entirely.  And if they tried to take the whole brake line out, the tires would fall off!  You could say that car theft would be very difficult if the brake line had been cut, since the car wouldn't work.  But you could say that car theft would be pretty easy if you were trying to steal a car with a twisted brake line.  So, yes, cutting the brake line is worse than taking the brake line off, but it isn't actually that hard to do the other thing.  And it's certainly harder to cut a brake line than it is to take the brake line out.",

There are also examples in history, such as the people who used scissor-like contraptions to pin humans to walls during medieval times.  The most common modern use of scissors as a weapon is perhaps the “scissor-fist”, in which an assailant holds a single pair of scissors up between their clenched fists and repeatedly strikes his opponent with the blades.",

I think it’s unlikely that individual taxpayers would want to take on the risk that one of their transactions might get audited.

If you want to take a scientific approach to it, you’d need to do a very detailed study of intelligence scores among lots of Mexicans and see if you could find some way to explain the difference.

The survivors said that they saw him hit the water, and the coast guard and the navy have been searching for the plane since shortly after it went missing.  Unfortunately, it’s pretty dark out now, and they haven’t found the plane.  The airplane will be on the ocean floor in around 20 feet of water, but it will be on the bottom and they’ll have to use sonar to find it.

In parts of Asia, there are many people who are addicted to opium, and they get some of their opium from legal or illegal sources.

Although people that have opium addiction in Asia have certain genetic traits, there are also people who have opium addiction that are not Asian.  And it’s not just certain “genes” that make people more likely to be addicted, so it’s also not just a genetic problem, and it’s also not just a racial problem.  This is not like in the history of Europe or North America, where there have been times when certain ethnic groups were prohibited from entering certain professions, or where laws were passed to exclude certain ethnic groups from particular geographical areas.

There’s more to it than that, of course, but it’s a good start.  I’m going to remind you that the origin of cheap oil was the petroleum revolution in Saudi Arabia in the 1920s, and the US-controlled production in Texas in the 1940s.
