    "question": "Based on Engineer: Semiplaning monohulls are a new kind of ship that can attain twice the speed of conventional ships. Due to increased fuel needs, transportation will be much more expensive on semiplaning monohulls than on conventional ships. Similarly, travel on jet airplanes was more expensive than travel on other planes at first, but jet airplanes still attracted enough passengers to be profitable, because they offered greater speed and reliability. Semiplaning monohulls offer the same advantages over traditional ships. Thus they will probably be profitable as well. Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the engineer's argument by the statement that transportation will be much more expensive on semiplaning monohulls than on traditional ships? A:\"It draws an analogy between semiplaning monohulls and conventional ships that constitutes an objection to the argument's main conclusion, one that is subsequently rejected by appeal to another analogy.\" B:\"It constitutes a potential objection to the argument's main conclusion, but is subsequently countered by an analogy drawn between ships and airplanes.\" C:\"It draws a distinction between characteristics of semiplaning monohulls and characteristics of conventional ships that the argument's main conclusion compares to a distinction between types of airplanes.\" D:\"It serves as one of two analogies drawn between semiplaning monohulls and jet airplanes, which function together to support the argument's main conclusion.\"",

    "question": "Based on When butterfat was considered nutritious and healthful, a law was enacted requiring that manufacturers use the term \"imitation butter\" to indicate butter whose butterfat content had been diminished through the addition of water. Today, it is known that the high cholesterol content of butterfat makes it harmful to human health. Since the public should be encouraged to eat foods with lower rather than higher butterfat content and since the term \"imitation\" with its connotations of falsity deters many people from purchasing products so designated, manufacturers who wish to give reduced-butterfat butter the more appealing name of \"lite butter\" should be allowed to do so. Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument? A:\"Most people deterred from eating \"imitation butter\" because of its name choose alternatives with a lower butterfat content than this product has.\" B:\"Some individuals who need to reduce their intake of cholesterol are not deterred from using the reduced-butterfat product by the negative connotations of the term \"imitation. \"\" C:\"The manufacturers who wish to call their product \"lite butter\" plan to change the composition of the product so that it contains more water than it now does.\" D:\"The manufacturers who prefer to use the word \"lite\" instead of \"imitation\" are motivated principally by the financial interest of their stockholders.\"",

    "question": "Based on Coherent solutions for the problem of reducing health-care costs cannot be found within the current piecemeal system of paying these costs. The reason is that this system gives health-care providers and insurers every incentive to shift, wherever possible, the costs of treating illness onto each other or any other party, including the patient. That clearly is the lesson of the various reforms of the 1980s: push in on one part of this pliable spending balloon and an equally expensive bulge pops up elsewhere. For example, when the government health-care insurance program for the poor cut costs by disallowing payments for some visits to physicians, patients with advanced illness later presented themselves at hospital emergency rooms in increased numbers. The argument proceeds by A:\"employing an analogy to characterize interrelationships\" B:\"demonstrating that cooperation is feasible by citing an instance\" C:\"attributing without justification fraudulent intent to people\" D:\"showing that shifting costs onto the patient contradicts the premise of health-care reimbursement\"",

    "question": "Based on Radioactive waste from nuclear power plants has been temporarily stored on-site, but this is not a satisfactory kind of place for long-range storage. Since no suitable plan of safe permanent storage of such waste from the nation' s existing and planned nuclear plants has been devised, some people propose that we should stop trying to develop such a plan and instead should shut down all present nuclear plants and build no new nuclear plants. The proposal mentioned above falls short of offering a complete solution to the problem it addresses because A:\"it would prevent the development of safe technologies for producing electric power\" B:\"it does not distinguish between nuclear plants that have, and plants that do not have, a reputation for operating safely\" C:\"it does not provide for the permanent storage of already-existing waste\" D:\"the risks of unsafe disposal of waste from nuclear power plants lie in the future, but the benefits from such plants are in the present\"",

    "question": "Based on Commentator: In academic scholarship, sources are always cited, and methodology and theoretical assumptions are set out, so as to allow critical study, replication, and expansion of scholarship. In open-source software, the code in which the program is written can be viewed and modified by individual users for their purposes without getting permission from the producer or paying a fee. In contrast, the code of proprietary software is kept secret, and modifications can be made only by the producer, for a fee. This shows that open-source software better matches the values embodied in academic scholarship, and since scholarship is central to the mission of universities, universities should use only open-source software. The commentator's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? A:\"Universities should use the type of software technology that is least expensive, as long as that type of software technology is adequate for the purposes of academic scholarship.\" B:\"A university should not pursue any activity that would block the achievement of the goals of academic scholarship at that university.\" C:\"The form of software technology that best matches the values embodied in the activities that are central to the mission of universities is the form of software technology that is most efficient for universities to use.\" D:\"Universities should choose the type of software technology that best matches the values embodied in the activities that are central to the mission of universities.\"",

A:\"It is presented as evidence for the claim that songbirds' predators are threatened by extinction unless they have open spaces and corridors that give them access to their prey.\" B:\"It is presented as a phenomenon that is compatible with the ornithologists' claim that the threat to songbirds continues to worsen.\" C:\"It is used as evidence that songbirds' predators will continue to have a habitat and so will continue to pose a threat to songbirds.\" D:\"It is used as evidence that various species of songbirds will continue to be threatened with extinction.\"",
