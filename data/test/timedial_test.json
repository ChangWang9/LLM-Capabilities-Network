It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance . Especially when descending , as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back , they sway around .

No wonder people give the title ' brave ' to anyone who jumps off . B: You see , the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then , like diving , their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth .

A: Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage . B: A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said , \" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform , I was extremely nervous . When I looked down , I was nervous even more . If the cord had broken , I would be knocked to ' bakemeat ' . However , I knew my worries were unwanted . I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me . I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward . I only felt wind wiring at my ears . My body rapidly descended . I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord . In fact it was 30 seconds . Maybe because of my nervousness , I only felt seven or <MASK> .

A: Certainly . Here's a survey report by a well-known lab in London , whose testimony is absolutely reliable . B: Though everything may be as you say , there are many factors involved . What's more , your surveyors have not mentioned any cause for the damage . A: The mushrooms were packed in small one pound plastic bags , sixty of these bags to a carton . It is stated on the surveyor ? s report that external conditions of goods at the time of survey are all sound and intact . So it is obvious the cause of the damage is that the mushrooms were not completely dried before packing . B: As you know , before shipment , the Commodity InspectionBureau inspected the goods in question . They concluded that the goods were well dehydrated from fresh and choice material and up to standard for export . A: I think the Inspection Bureau at your end , when effecting inspection , only selected a few package at random these happened to be up to the standard . The part that was not dried properly , most probably , escaped their attention . As the amount in question is only 20 % of the whole shipment , I think it is only reasonable that you should compensate us for the loss . B: The inspection certificate , which is based on a random selection of 20 % of the consignment as we've agreed on beforehand , is considered final and binding upon both parties . We do not accept any claims for compensation for loss incurred in transit , because you bought the goods F . O . B . Houston and on shipping quality , not on landed quality . Your claim , in our opinion , should be referred to the insurance company , as the mishap occurred after shipment . A: We've already got in touch with the underwriter . But they have refused to accept any liability . They attributed the accident to the effects of dampness during the long sea voyage . B: That's a matter over which we could exercise no control , then . I'm afraid I have to insist that you approach the insurance company for settlement , that is , if you have covered this risk in your coverage . A: To my regret , we failed to cover contamination . This is an unfortunate oversight on our part and a lesson to us . B: Otherwise the insurance company would no doubt have entertained your case . A: Well , live and learn . It seems we'll have to waive the claim . Options: A:\"two weeks ago\" B:\"20 days ago\" C:\"20 minutes ago\" D:\"20 years ago\"",

B: Oh , my God ! John , I didn ' t know you are religious . You just look like a scientific kook , like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory . A: Come on , Han Maimed , don ' t make a fuss .

How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist ? A: That ' s a little complicated . You ' ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U . S . history later on .

A: Absolutely ! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England . B: Why was it founded by the Puritans ? Where were the atheistic educators ? A: Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans . B: How come ? I mean why most of them were religious people ?

B: So , you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England ? A: Yes , that's why Puritans moved to the New World , where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans . Later on , it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College . B: Why did they want to found a college ? A: Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England . They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well . B: Oh , I see . A: Actually Harvard was first named ' New College ' , without a formal name . B: When did it begin to be called Harvard University ? A: In <MASK> , it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard . Interestingly , JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman .
