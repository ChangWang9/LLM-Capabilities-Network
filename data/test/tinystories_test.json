Timmy tried to make the barber happy by telling him a joke, but the barber didn't laugh.  After the haircut, Timmy and his dad went to the store to buy some candy.

When they got home, Timmy's mom was proud of him for not eating too much candy. She told him that even though candy tastes good, it's important to take care of your teeth.
