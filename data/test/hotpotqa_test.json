Franquin's most notable accomplishment while at the Paris Conservatory was his push for the C Trumpet to replace the low F trumpet as a more versatile orchestral instrument.

    "question": "Based on the context: Lion-class battleship: The \"Lion\"-class battleships were a class of six fast battleships designed for the Royal Navy in the late 1930s.  They were a larger, improved version of the \"King George V\" class with 16 in guns.  Only two ships were laid down before the Second World War began in September 1939 and a third was ordered during the war, but their construction was suspended shortly afterwards.  Their design changed several times in response to the removal of treaty restrictions on size and in light of war experience.  None of the other ships planned were laid down, although there was a proposal to modify one of the suspended ships into a hybrid battleship/aircraft carrier with two 16-inch gun turrets and a flight deck.  The two ships already begun were scrapped after the end of the war. List of battlecruisers of Russia: After the end of the Russo-Japanese War of 1905, the Russian Naval General Staff decided that it needed a squadron of fast \"armored cruisers\" that could use their speed to maneuver into position to engage the head of the enemy's battle line, much as Admiral Tōgō had done during the Battle of Tsushima against the Russian fleet.  This concept was very different from the primary roles for the battlecruiser envisioned by the British Royal Navy and the Imperial German High Seas Fleet, which consisted of scouting for the main battle fleet and attacking enemy reconnaissance forces.  The Royal Navy came to the same conclusion and developed the \"Queen Elizabeth\"-class fast battleships that could force battle on an enemy fleet and had enough protection to attack any type of ship.  However, World War I and the Russian Civil War interrupted the construction of the Russian \"Borodino\"-class ships and all were scrapped. Number 13-class battleship: The \"Number 13\"-class battleship was a planned class of four fast battleships to be built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1920s.  The ships never received any names, being known only as \"Numbers 13–16\".  They were intended to reinforce Japan's \"eight-eight fleet\" of eight battleships and eight battlecruisers after the United States announced a major naval construction program in 1919.  The \"Number 13\" class was designed to be superior to all other existing battleships, planned or building.  After the signing of the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922, they were cancelled in November 1923 before construction could begin.

Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \"I Am Not a Freemdoom\", also on Kindercore.

It was first introduced in 1941 aboard their \"North Carolina\"-class battleship s, replacing the originally intended 14\"/50 caliber Mark B guns and was also used for the follow-up \"South Dakota\" class.  These battleships carried nine guns in three three-gun turrets.  The gun was an improvement to the 16\"/45 caliber guns used aboard the \"Colorado\" class , and the predecessor to the 16\"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun used aboard the \"Iowa\" class .

Ties are further strengthened by the presence of an estimated 150,000-200,000 Ecuadorians living in the United States and by 24,000 U.S. citizens visiting Ecuador annually, and by approximately 15,000 U.S. citizens residing in Ecuador.  The United States assists Ecuador's economic development directly through the Agency for International Development (USAID) program in Ecuador and through multilateral organizations such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the World Bank.  In addition, the U.S. Peace Corps operates a sizable program in Ecuador.  More than 100 U.S. companies are doing business in Ecuador. Inter-American Peace Force: The Inter-American Peace Force (IAPF) was established, by the Organization of American States, on 23 May 1965, after the United States's intervention in the Dominican Republic.  It largely consisted of over 42,600 United States military personnel, plus the following troops were sent by each country; United States and the Haitian Revolution: The Haitian Revolution provoked mixed reactions in the United States.  In June 1793 when the Haitian people, led by Toussaint Louverture, overthrew the French colonial rule and declared themselves an independent colony, it made the neighboring United States uneasy.  The slaves in Saint-Domingue’s were able to observe the growing disunity among the white colonists and themselves.  They realized that they would need to seek an opportunity to stop the tyranny that was being placed upon them, thus they took a stand and revolted.  The Haitian Revolution of 1804 impacted the United States of America, led by Thomas Jefferson, instilling fear of racial instability in the US, and the possible problematic effect the revolution could have on the early foreign relations and trade between the US and the new independent Haiti.  Thomas Jefferson realized that the Haitian Revolution had the potential to cause an upheaval against slavery in the US not only by the slaves themselves, but by white abolitionists as well.  Southern slaveholders feared that the revolt might spread from the island of Hispaniola to the slave plantations of the Southern United States.  The primary goal of the US was to maintain social order in the country, so the United States attempted to suppress the Haitian Revolution.  The US even went as far as to refuse acknowledgement of Haitian independence until 1862, which was during the heat of the North American civil war; coincidentally the main causal factor for the war between the states was slavery.  The second major impact that the Haitian Revolution had on the United States was on early foreign relations and trade that had been conducted with Haiti.  The United States had conducted trade and commerce with the Haitian island under French rule during the eighteenth century.  Haiti was the main producer of the United States supply of sugar and coffee, and once the Haitian slave population had broken from slavery, the US was reluctant to continue trade with them in fear that they would upset the French and the Southern slaveholders.  American merchants conducted a substantial trade with the plantations on Hispaniola (aka the French colony of Saint Domingue or Haiti).  But there were anti-slavery advocates in northern cities who believed that consistency with the principles of the American Revolution — life, liberty and equality for all—demanded that the U.S. support the slave insurgents.  An extremely beneficial aspect and real estate triumph that resulted from the Haitian Revolution and impacted the United States was the Louisiana Purchase.  Once Napoleon had lost his control of the land holding in the Caribbean to the Haitian rebellion, he felt that the French territory in the southern part of the United States was useless to the French Empire.  The US was only interested in the New Orleans area; however, the revolution enabled the sale of the entire territory west of the Mississippi River for around $15 million.  This purchase more than doubled the United States’ territory.

Like his companion Henry Lee Lucas, Toole made confessions he later recanted, but which resulted in murder convictions.  The discrediting of the case against Lucas for crimes in which Toole had offered corroborating statements created doubts as to whether either was a genuine serial killer or, as Hugh Aynesworth suggested, both were merely compliant interviewees whom police used to clear unsolved murders from the books.  Toole received two death sentences, but on appeal they were commuted to life imprisonment.  He died in his cell from cirrhosis, aged 49.  Police attributed the murder of Adam Walsh to Toole on the basis of recanted statements.

This part is nowadays sometimes taken by a celesta.  Maurice Ravel preferred the keyboard version of the instrument because it can play a true ff dynamic for brilliance and iridescence in orchestral climaxes.

Pitchout: In baseball, a pitchout is a ball that is intentionally thrown high and outside of the strike zone with the purpose of preventing a stolen base, thwarting a hit and run, or to prevent a run-scoring play on a suicide squeeze play.  The pitcher delivers the ball in such a manner for it to be unhittable and in a position where the catcher can quickly leap to his feet to catch it.  A well-thrown pitchout will allow the catcher to receive the ball standing up as opposed to his usual squat, giving him a better line to throw to a base without the pitcher or the batter obstructing his vision or aim.  Moreover, it is easier to throw a ball with more force from a standing position than it is from a squat, which is why most catchers leap to their feet when attempting to throw out a base stealer.  A pitchout is a type of intentional ball, but differs in that a pitchout is thrown harder to give the catcher the most time to throw out the base runner.

In recent decades it has been questioned whether these were in fact the same author, although it seems that both were Carmelites.  Other historians see no reason to create an extra author, but recent French publications tend to refer to the \"Chronique dite de Jean de Venette\" (\"Chronicle said to be by Jean de Venette\").  By his own account the chronicler was of peasant origin, and his view of the events of his lifetime has a significantly different perspective from that of other chroniclers. Le Livre de l'Espérance: Le \"Livre de l’Espérance\", (The Book of Hope) also called the \"Consolation des Trois Vertus\" or the \"Livre de l’Exile\", was written by the French poet and statesman Alain Chartier.  Begun in 1429, the work was not yet complete by the author's death in 1430.  It is a lengthy dream vision and allegory of political, theological and poetic significance written in both verse and prose Middle French.  Modeled on the Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius, instead of finding consolation through Dame Philosophy, it is the three Christian virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, who offer solace.

    "question": "Based on the context: Ratner's theorems: In mathematics, Ratner's theorems are a group of major theorems in ergodic theory concerning unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces proved by Marina Ratner around 1990.  The theorems grew out of Ratner's earlier work on horocycle flows.  The study of the dynamics of unipotent flows played a decisive role in the proof of the Oppenheim conjecture by Grigory Margulis.  Ratner's theorems have guided key advances in the understanding of the dynamics of unipotent flows.  Their later generalizations provide ways to both sharpen the results and extend the theory to the setting of arbitrary semisimple algebraic groups over a local field. Oseledets theorem: In mathematics, the multiplicative ergodic theorem, or Oseledets theorem provides the theoretical background for computation of Lyapunov exponents of a nonlinear dynamical system.  It was proved by Valery Oseledets (also spelled \"Oseledec\") in 1965 and reported at the International Mathematical Congress in Moscow in 1966.  A conceptually different proof of the multiplicative ergodic theorem was found by M. S. Raghunathan.  The theorem has been extended to semisimple Lie groups by V. A. Kaimanovich and further generalized in the works of David Ruelle, Grigory Margulis, Anders Karlsson, and François Ledrappier.

    "question": "Based on the context: Bag of Bones: Bag of Bones is a 1998 novel by Stephen King.  It focuses on an author who suffers severe writer's block and delusions at an isolated lake house four years after the death of his wife.  It won the Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel in 1998, and the British Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1999.  The book re-uses many basic plot elements of Daphne du Maurier's \"Rebecca\", which is directly referenced several times in the book's opening pages; however, the relation of these elements (including a wife who is dead as the book opens, her posthumous effect on future romance, a drowning, and house haunted by the memories of previous inhabitants) to the plot and characters is markedly different.  When the paperback edition of \"Bag of Bones\" was published by Pocket Books on June 1, 1999 (ISBN  ), it included a new author's note at the end of the book, in which Stephen King describes his initial three-book deal with Scribner (\"Bag of Bones\", \"\", and a collection of short stories titled \"One Headlight\", which later became \"Everything's Eventual\"), and devotes most of the piece describing the origins of the then-forthcoming \"Hearts in Atlantis\".

During an outbreak of fever, John is suddenly taken ill and Bella nurses him back to health.  At the time of its production, the term \"ghetto\" was a buzzword and the focus of the hardworking Jewess struggling to survive was a focus of other 1910 productions.  The film was released on July 19, 1910, and received criticism for not having the character appear to be Jewish and incorrectly portraying her place of work as a sweatshop.  The film is presumed lost. Too Far to Go: Too Far to Go is a collection of short stories by the American author John Updike published in 1979 in conjunction with the showing of a two-hour television movie on the NBC network with Blythe Danner, Michael Moriarty, Kathryn Walker and Glenn Close.

Many of the stories were initially published as occasional stories in \"The New Yorker\" from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s.  The story \"Your Lover Just Called\" was later adapted into a playlet by Updike himself.  It is included in his collection \"More Matter\" (1999).

Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals.  Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either the draft or free agency.

He was a leading composer for the stage who was best known for his fruitful collaborations with Bertolt Brecht.  With Brecht, he developed productions such as his best-known work \"The Threepenny Opera\", which included the ballad \"Mack the Knife\".  Weill held the ideal of writing music that served a socially useful purpose.  He also wrote several works for the concert hall.  He became a United States citizen on August 27, 1943. Saint Joan of the Stockyards: Saint Joan of the Stockyards (German: \"Die Heilige Johanna der Schlachthöfe\" ) is a play written by the German modernist playwright Bertolt Brecht between 1929 and 1931, after the success of his musical \"The Threepenny Opera\" and during the period of his radical experimental work with the \"Lehrstücke\".  It is based on the musical that he co-authored with Elisabeth Hauptmann, \"Happy End\" (1929).  In this version of the story of Joan of Arc, Brecht transforms her into \"Joan Dark\", a member of the \"Black Straw Hats\" (a Salvation Army-like group) in 20th-century Chicago.  The play charts Joan's battle with Pierpont Mauler, the unctuous owner of a meat-packing plant.  Like her predecessor, Joan is a doomed woman, a martyr and (initially, at least) an innocent in a world of strike-breakers, fat cats, and penniless workers.  Like many of Brecht's plays it is laced with humor and songs as part of its epic dramaturgical structure and deals with the theme of emancipation from material suffering and exploitation.

    "question": "Based on the context: Hurricane Baker (1950): Hurricane Baker was a major hurricane that affected the Leeward Islands, Greater Antilles, and the Gulf Coast of the United States.  The tropical cyclone was the second intense hurricane, second hurricane, and second tropical storm of the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season.  Hurricane Baker attained peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) near the Leeward Islands, traversed Antigua, and weakened to a tropical depression southwest of Puerto Rico.  It re-intensified south of Cuba, strengthened to a strong Category 2 hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, and hit the United States near Gulf Shores, Alabama, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h).  Hurricane Baker produced extensive damage in the Lesser Antilles and Cuba, but impacts were minimal in the United States. Hurricane Joaquin: Hurricane Joaquin (] ) was a powerful tropical cyclone that devastated several districts of the Bahamas and caused damage in the Turks and Caicos Islands, parts of the Greater Antilles, and Bermuda.  It was also the strongest Atlantic hurricane of non-tropical origin in the satellite era.  The tenth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2015 Atlantic hurricane season, Joaquin evolved from a non-tropical low to become a tropical depression on September 28, well southwest of Bermuda.  Tempered by unfavorable wind shear, the depression drifted southwestward.  After becoming a tropical storm the next day, Joaquin underwent rapid intensification, reaching hurricane status on September 30 and Category 4 major hurricane strength on October 1.  Meandering over the southern Bahamas, Joaquin's eye passed near or over several islands.  On October 3, the hurricane weakened somewhat and accelerated to the northeast.  Abrupt re-intensification ensued later that day, and Joaquin acquired sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just short of Category 5 strength. Hurricane Katia (2011): Hurricane Katia was a classic Cape Verde hurricane that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone.  The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August 29.  It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September 1, although unfavorable atmospheric conditions hindered strengthening thereafter.  As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September 5 and peak as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) that afternoon.  Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 10.

Perry Index: The Perry Index is a widely used index of \"Aesop's Fables\" or \"Aesopica\", the fables credited to Aesop, the storyteller who lived in ancient Greece between 620 and 560 BC.

Traditionally, Aesop's fables were arranged alphabetically, which is not helpful to the reader.  B. E. Perry listed them by language (Greek then Latin), chronologically, by source, and then alphabetically; the Spanish scholar Francisco Rodríguez Adrados created a similar system.

It honors Francisco de Miranda and was adopted as the official anthem on December 22, 1909. Agathangelos: Agathangelos (in Classical Armenian: Ագաթանգեղոս Agatʿangełos, in Greek Ἀγαθάγγελος \"bearer of good news\" or angel, 4th or 5th centuries AD), appropriately so named, was a supposed secretary of Tiridates III, King of Armenia, under whose name there has come down a life of the first apostle of Armenia, Gregory the Illuminator, who died about 332.  It purports to exhibit the deeds and discourses of Gregory, and has reached us in Armenian and in Greek.  The text of this history has been considerably altered, but it has always been in high favor with the Armenians.  Von Gutschmid maintains that the unknown author made use of a genuine life of St. Gregory, also of a history of his martyrdom and of that of Saint Rhipsime and her companions.  Historical facts are intermingled in this life with legendary or uncertain additions, and the whole is woven into a certain unity by the narrator, who may have assumed his significant name from his quality of narrator of \"the good news\" of Armenia's conversion.  It has been translated into several languages, and Greek and Latin translations are found in the \"Acta Sanctorum Bollandistarum\", tome viii. Unknown God: The Unknown God or Agnostos Theos (Ancient Greek: Ἄγνωστος Θεός ) is a theory by Eduard Norden first published in 1913 that proposes, based on the Christian Apostle Paul's Areopagus speech in Acts , that in addition to the twelve main gods and the innumerable lesser deities, ancient Greeks worshipped a deity they called \"Agnostos Theos\", that is: \"Unknown God\", which Norden called \"Un-Greek\".  In Athens, there was a temple specifically dedicated to that god and very often Athenians would swear \"in the name of the Unknown God\" (Νὴ τὸν Ἄγνωστον \"Ne ton Agnoston\").  Apollodorus, Philostratus and Pausanias wrote about the Unknown God as well.

    "question": "Based on the context: Flamenco rock: Flamenco rock or Andalusian rock is a rock music subgenre that emerged from (but is not limited to) the Spanish region of Andalusia throughout the late 1960s and early 1970s.  There were some precedents like a couple of albums (\"Rock encounter (with Joe Beck)\" and \"The Soul of Flamenco and the Essence of Rock\") by Sabicas, a couple of singles (\"El garrotín / Tangos de Ketama\" and \"Ni recuerdo ni Olvido\") by Smash, Gong, Galaxia, Flamenco or even the American band Carmen.  However, Triana was recognized as a pioneer of the genre since their music focuses on a complete fusion of the progressive rock and flamenco.  Many bands that mix progressive and symphonic rock with flamenco followed them such as Imán Califato independiente, Cai, Guadalquivir, Alameda or Mezquita; that's why the term \"Andalusian rock\" may be understood simply as flamenco prog.  Medina Azahara turned from progressive to a hard rock outfit in the 1980s and they remain as one of the most popular flamenco rock bands in its home nation.  Also other flamenco-influenced styles of rock emerged like the flamenco-folk band Veneno, flamenco-jazz-blues band Pata Negra among other bands that melted flamenco with African, reggae or Latin rhythms. West Coast hip hop: West Coast hip hop is a hip hop music subgenre that encompasses any artists or music that originate in the West Coast region of the United States.  The gangsta rap subgenre of West Coast hip hop began to dominate from a radio play and sales standpoint during the early 1990s with the birth of G-funk and the emergence of Suge Knight and Dr. Dre's Death Row Records. Latin rock: Latin rock is a term to describe a music subgenre consisting in melting traditional sounds and elements of Latin American and Caribbean folk with rock music.  However, it is widely used in the English-language media to refer any kind of rock music featuring Spanish or Portuguese vocals.  This fact lead into a controversy about the scope of the terminology.

After All (The Miracles song): \"After All\" is a 1960 song written by Smokey Robinson and originally recorded and released by The Miracles on the Tamla label.  It was later covered as an unreleased single by The Supremes for Tamla; it was canceled in favor of the single \"Buttered Popcorn\", and their cover wasn't released until it appeared on the 2000 box set, \"The Supremes\".  The song is noted for both groups' unusual choices for leads.  For the Miracles' version it serves as a rare lead for Claudette Rogers Robinson, instead of the group’s main lead, Claudette's husband, Smokey Robinson.  In the Supremes' case it is their only single to feature Barbara Martin singing on lead vocals (although she does have a spoken line during the song \"(He's) Seventeen\").  Florence Ballard, Mary Wilson, and Diana Ross sing verses, and Martin sings the bridge (usually Ballard or Ross was given the lead on the group's recordings at that time).  \"After All\" was also later covered by The Marvelettes, in the early 1970s, with group member Wanda Young Rogers as lead.  (There's a connection to the two previous groups in that Wanda Young was the wife of Miracles member Bobby Rogers, and she was the only member of The Marvelettes on the song—as with the late-1960s singles of The Supremes, The Andantes served as background singers.)

One of the leading and influential conductors of the early and mid-20th Century, he is best known for his long association with the Philadelphia Orchestra and for appearing in the film \"Fantasia\".  He was especially noted for his free-hand conducting style that spurned the traditional baton and for obtaining a characteristically sumptuous sound from the orchestras he directed. Symphony No. 1 &quot;The Gothic&quot; (Brian): The Symphony No. 1 in D minor (The Gothic) by Havergal Brian is a symphony composed between 1919 and 1927.  At around one and three quarter hours, it is among the longest symphonies ever composed (with Mahler's 3rd Symphony, Sorabji's nine-hour 2nd Organ Symphony and Dimitrie Cuclin's unperformed No. 12) and, along with choral symphonies such as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony or Mahler's 8th Symphony, it is one of a few works attempting to use the musically gigantic to address the spiritual concerns of humanity.  With a key-scheme that begins in D minor and comes eventually to a closing in E major, the work is an example of progressive tonality. Symphony No. 6 (Mahler): Symphony No. 6 in A minor by Gustav Mahler is a symphony in four movements, composed in 1903 and 1904 (revised 1906; scoring repeatedly revised).

Mahler composed the symphony at what was apparently an exceptionally happy time in his life, as he had married Alma Schindler in 1902, and during the course of the work's composition his second daughter was born.  This contrasts with the tragic, even nihilistic, ending of No. 6.  Both Alban Berg and Anton Webern praised the work when they first heard it.  Berg expressed his opinion of the stature of this symphony in a 1908 letter to Webern: Question: The first recording of the Mahler Symphony No. 8 was conducted by which Jewish-Polish-Irish bandleader?",

    "question": "Based on the context: Campylopus introflexus: Campylopus introflexus, the heath star moss, is a species of moss.  It has a native southern hemisphere distribution in southern South America, southern part of Africa, southern and eastern Australia, and Atlantic and Pacific islands such as New Zealand, New Caledonia and the South Sandwich Islands.  It is a neophyte in Europe and coastal western North America.  In some parts of Europe and North America the species has become invasive.  It can be found in a variety of settings, from bogs to dunes to flat roofs, often decalcified habitats.  Individual plants measure 0.5 - , with lanceolate (lance-shaped) leaves 4 - .  The plants are found in dense mats and are yellowish to olive green.  This species will sometimes reproduce asexually by means of stem tips that break off and are distributed by the wind.  Multiple sporophytes are often present in one plant.  It produces spores of 12–14 µm in size. Exochorda: Exochorda is a small genus of flowering plants in the family Rosaceae, native to China and central Asia (Turkestan).  They are used as ornamental plants with the common name pearl bush, or pearlbush.  Numerous species have been described on the basis of differing appearance and geographical separation, but a systematic study revealed that the different types are closely related and probably all descended from a single species that formerly had a wide distribution that has been fragmented by habitat loss.  As a single species the correct name is \"E. racemosa\". Lobelia deckenii: Lobelia deckenii (syn.  \"Lobelia keniensis\") is a species of giant lobelia of the mountains of East Africa.  It grows in moist areas, such as valley bottoms and moorland, in contrast to \"Lobelia telekii\" which grows in a similar, but drier habitat.  These two species produce occasional hybrids.  \"Lobelia deckenii\" plants usually produce multiple rosettes.  Each rosette grows for several decades, produces a single large inflorescence and hundreds of thousands of seeds, then dies.  Because individual plants have multiple rosettes, they survive to reproduce repeatedly, and plants with more rosettes flower more frequently.  It is iteroparous.

    "question": "Based on the context: Streptobacillus moniliformis: Streptobacillus moniliformis is a non-motile, Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium that is a member of the family Leptotrichiaceae.  The genome of \"S. moniliformis\" is one of two completed sequences of the order Fusobacteriales.  Its name comes the Greek word \"streptos\" for \"curved\" or \"twisted\", and the Latin words \"bacillus\" meaning \"small rod\" and \"moniliformis\" for \"necklace\".  \"S. moniliformis\" is microaerophilic, requiring less oxygen than is present in the atmosphere for its growth. Biblical accommodation: Biblical accommodation is the adaptation of words or sentences from the Bible to signify ideas different from those expressed therein.  Thus, if a sinner excuses his fault by saying, \"The serpent deceived me\", he applies the scriptural words of Eve (Gen., iii, 13) to express an idea which the sentence does not convey in the Bible.  Similarly, a blind person might use the words of Tob., v, 12, \"What manner of joy shall be to me, who sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven\".  Here, again, the words would have a meaning which they do not bear in Sacred Scripture.  This accommodation is sometimes incorrectly styled the accommodated, or accommodative, sense of Scripture.  From the definition it is clear that it is not a sense of Scripture at all.  The possibility of such accommodation may arise, first, from some similarity between the ideas in the sacred text and the subject to which the passage is accommodated; secondly, from the fact that the words of Scripture may be understood in two different senses.  The first is called extensive accommodation.  Examples of it are found in the Church's offices, both in the Breviary and the Missal, when the praises bestowed by the Holy Ghost on Noe, Isaac, and Moses are applied to other saints.  Thus the words of Ecclus., xxxii, 1, 5: \"Have they made thee ruler?  . . . hinder not music\" are sometimes applied to College presidents assuming the burden of their office; we need not say that the words of Sacred Scripture have quite a different meaning.  The second species of accommodation, called allusive, is often a mere play on words and at times seems due to a misunderstanding of the original meaning.  The Vulgate text, \"Mirabilis Deus in sanctis suis\" (Ps., lxvii, 36) means, in the mouth of the Psalmist, that God is wonderful in His sanctuary (sancta, -orum).  The Latin words may also be translated \"God is wonderful in his saints\" (sancti, -orum), and they are employed in this sense in the Missal.  As this second signification was not intended by the inspired writer, the English rendering of the text in the Douay-Rheims version is a mistranslation. Elachista canapennella: Elachista canapennella is a moth of the Elachistidae family.  It is found from Fennoscandia and northern Russia to the Pyrenees, Italy and Romania and from Ireland to central Russia.

    "question": "Based on the context: Tamil literature: Tamil literature (Tamil: தமிழ் இலக்கியம் ) refers to the literature in the Tamil language.  Tamil literature has a rich and long literary tradition spanning more than two thousand years.  The oldest extant works show signs of maturity indicating an even longer period of evolution.  Contributors to the Tamil literature are mainly from Tamil people from South India, including the land now comprising Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Sri Lankan Tamils from Sri Lanka, and from Tamil diaspora.  The history of Tamil literature follows the history of Tamil Nadu, closely following the social, political and cultural trends of various periods.  The early Sangam literature, starting from the period of 2nd century BCE, contain anthologies of various poets dealing with many aspects of life, including love, war, social values and religion.  This was followed by the early epics and moral literature, authored by Hindu, Jain and Buddhist authors, lasting up to the 5th century CE.  From the 6th to 12th century CE, the Tamil devotional poems written by Nayanmars (sages of Shaivism) and Azhvars (sages of Vaishnavism), heralded the great Bhakti movement which later engulfed the entire Indian subcontinent.  It is during this era that some of the grandest of Tamil literary classics like Kambaramayanam and Periya Puranam were authored and many poets were patronized by the imperial Chola and Pandya empires.  The later medieval period saw many assorted minor literary works and also contributions by a few Muslim and European authors.  By having the most ancient non-Sanskritized Indian literature, Tamil literature is unique and thus has become the subject of study by scholars who wish to delineate the non-Aryan and pre-Aryan strands in Indian culture. The Autumn People: The Autumn People is a mass-market paperback collection of comic adaptations of eight short horror and crime stories by Ray Bradbury, gathered from the pages of the EC Comics comic books of the 1950s.  It is one of five EC collections published by Ballantine Books between 1964 and 1966 (the others are \"Tales from the Crypt\", \"The Vault of Horror\", \"Tales of the Incredible\" and \"Tomorrow Midnight\"), and one of two made up of comic adaptations of Bradbury's work (the other is \"Tomorrow Midnight\").  The presentation of the material is problematic at best, since the color comic book pages are represented in black and white and broken into horizontal strips to fit the mass-market paperback format.  Still, the collections are historically important.  They were the first attempt to resurrect the EC comics, only a decade after public outcry had driven them off the racks.  They were the first introduction of those comics to a generation of readers too young to remember them in their first run. Glenn Eichler: Glenn Eichler is an American comedy writer who started out as an editor for \"National Lampoon\" magazine.

    "question": "Based on the context: Tunnel field-effect transistor: The tunnel field-effect transistor (TFET) is an experimental type of transistor.  Even though its structure is very similar to a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect (MOSFET), the fundamental switching mechanism differs, making this device a promising candidate for low power electronics.  TFETs switch by modulating quantum tunneling through a barrier instead of modulating thermionic emission over a barrier as in traditional MOSFETs.  Because of this, TFETs are not limited by the thermal Maxwell–Boltzmann tail of carriers, which limits MOSFET drain current subthreshold swing to about 60 mV/decade of current at room temperature (exactly 63 mV/decade at 300 K).  Joerg Appenzeller and his colleagues at IBM were the first to demonstrate that current swings below the MOSFET’s 60-mV-per-decade limit were possible.  In 2004, they reported they had created a tunnel transistor with a carbon nanotube channel and a subthreshold swing of just 40 mV per decade.

There are many common acts relating to Partnerships in both legal systems but there are also many differences for example under Scots Law a Partnership is considered to be a distinct legal entity and therefore can borrow money from a bank in the name of the Partnership.  Under English law a Partnership is not a distinct legal entity and therefore borrowing would be in the names of the individual partners.  Partnerships are a form of business association, which arises automatically when people carry on business with a view to a profit.  (Partnership Act 1890 s 1).  Partners are jointly and severally liable, just as they own the property in common.  A limited partnership, under the Limited Partnerships Act 1907 may have sleeping partners, who if they do not partake in any business management will not be liable beyond their investments (s 6).  A ‘partnership’ under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2000 is now considered a separate legal person (s 11) with limited liability (ss 1 and 14), though it is treated as a partnership for tax, and is not subject to so much regulation as would be a company.

Gonzales is still sometimes considered to be a candidate for the greatest tennis player of all time; he was the dominant player of the 1950s and still holds the men's all-time record of being ranked world No. 1 for eight years.  Rosewall became the world's best player upon Gonzales's semi-retirement in 1961 and held that position either by himself or sharing it with others for six years.  Rosewall was signed in 1956 by the promoter Jack Kramer, a former #1 player himself, to join his small band of touring professionals in 1957.  He then engaged in a round-the-world, head-to-head tour against Gonzales, the defending world's champion, over the next five months, winning 26 matches but losing 50.  In his 1979 autobiography Kramer included both Gonzales and Rosewall in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.  Kramer, however, initially \"panicked\" upon signing Rosewall.He was a cute little fellow with a dink serve, who operated mostly from the baseline.  That great volley of his hadn't been developed yet.  I was afraid that Gorgo would eat him alive and put us out of business the rest of the way.  But like a lot of people I completely underestimated Rosewall.  Before their opening match in Melbourne, Kramer went to Gonzales and asked him to \"carry\" Rosewall, giving him a better share of the gate to gain his assent.  Gonzales did try to carry out his part of the deal for a few matches, but then called it off, telling Kramer that he was no longer able to play his normal game.  Kramer agreed.  \"It was... obvious that Rosewall was not the pushover I had feared.  (In fact, Gonzales only beat him 50–26, and it was always competitive.)\"  Six years older than Rosewall, 13 years later, in 1970, Gonzales defeated him in 6–4, 6–4, in the 199th and next-to-last match they ever played—Gonzales was 42 years old at the time and Rosewall was considered to be the co-No.  1 player in the world.
