And ordinary people also believe that humans may usher in the era of \"customized babies\". Query: Which of the following, if true, would best refute the views of ordinary people? Options: A. \"Artificial\" genetic screening does not rule out that there will be loopholes; in natural conception, the guidelines for survival of the fittest in nature seem to be more subtle and effective. B. It can be seen from the development history of modern science and technology that technological development is often faster than human cognition, and sometimes technology will go further and deviate from the track of human cognition.

    "question": "Context: By analyzing the light released or absorbed by the atoms of an object, you can measure whether the object is far away from the earth or close to the earth. When the object is far away from the earth, the frequency of these lights will move to the red end (low frequency) of the spectrum, referred to as \"red shift\" \"On the contrary, it is called\" blue shift \". The unique light emitted by the atoms is also affected by the mass of the elementary particles that make up the atoms, especially the electrons. If the mass of an atom increases, the energy of the photons it releases will also become higher, so the release and absorption frequencies will be blue-shifted. Conversely, if the particles become lighter and lighter, the frequency will be red-shifted. Astronomical observations have found that most galaxies have a redshift phenomenon. Moreover, the farther the galaxy is from the earth, the greater the redshift. According to this, many scientists believe that the universe must be constantly expanding.

Supporters believe that reanimated animals are expected to restore the damaged ecological environment in some areas. For example, Mammoths live on the vast grasslands of Siberia, and their excrement is an excellent fertilizer to nourish the grasslands.
